At radio frequencies, free from dust extinction, it is possible to detect compact components within the innermost LIRG nuclear regions, such as SNe and SN remnants, as well as AGN buried deep in the LIRG nuclei. We studied the LIRG IC883 aiming at: (i) investigating its (circum-)nuclear regions using the e-EVN at 5GHz, and e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz, complemented by archival VLBI data; (ii) detecting at radio frequencies the two recently reported circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi, which were discovered by near-IR (NIR) adaptive optics observations of IC883; and (iii) further investigating the nature of SN2011hi at NIR by means of observations with Gemini-North. The circumnuclear regions traced by e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz have an extension of ~1kpc, and show a striking double-sided structure, which very likely corresponds to a warped rotating ring, in agreement with previous studies. Our e-EVN observations at 5GHz and complementary archival VLBI data at 5GHz and 8.4GHz, reveal the presence of various milliarcsec compact components in the nucleus of IC883. A single compact source, an AGN candidate, dominates the emission at both nuclear and circumnuclear scales, as imaged with the e-EVN and e-MERLIN, respectively. The other milliarcsec components are very suggestive of ongoing nuclear CCSN activity. Our e-EVN observations also resulted in upper limits to the radio luminosity of the two SNe in IC883 recently discovered at NIR. We refine the classification of SN2011hi as a Type IIP SN according to our latest Gemini-North epoch from 2012, in agreement with a low-luminosity radio SN nature. We estimate a CCSN rate lower limit of 1.1_{-0.6}^{+1.3} yr^{-1} for the entire galaxy, based on three nuclear radio SNe and the circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi. (abridged)',\n",

Witten's classic argument that baryons and interacting systems of baryons can be described in a mean-field approximation with each of the quarks moving in an average potential due to the remaining quarks is heuristic. It is important to justify this heuristic description for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting baryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the possibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up the entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful states coupled together to make a color-singlet state. In this work, we provide a formal justification of this heuristic prescription. In order to do this, we start by taking the heavy quark limit, thus effectively reducing the problem to a many-body quantum mechanical system. This problem can be formulated in terms of integrals over coherent states, which for this problem are simple Slater determinants. We show that for the many-body problem, the support region for these integrals becomes narrow at large $N_c$, yielding an energy which is well-approximated by a single coherent state---that is a mean-field description. Corrections to the energy are of relative order $1/N_c$. While hidden color states are present in the exact state of the heavy quark system, they only influence the interaction energy at sub-leading order in $1/N_{c}$.\",\n",

Here we show an experimentally significant approximate dynamical effect, namely a vector superposition effect which arises under certain dynamical conditions when we have absolute motion and gravitational in-flows: the velocities for these processes are shown to be approximately vectorially additive under these conditions. This effect plays a key role in interpreting the data from the numerous experiments that detected the absolute linear motion of the earth. The violations of this superposition effect lead to observable effects, such as the generation of turbulence. The flow theory also leads to vorticity effects that the Gravity Probe B gyroscope experiment will soon begin observing.

We studied the LIRG IC883 aiming at: (i) investigating its (circum-)nuclear regions using the e-EVN at 5GHz, and e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz, complemented by archival VLBI data; (ii) detecting at radio frequencies the two recently reported circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi, which were discovered by near-IR (NIR) adaptive optics observations of IC883; and (iii) further investigating the nature of SN2011hi at NIR by means of observations with Gemini-North. The circumnuclear regions traced by e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz have an extension of ~1kpc, and show a striking double-sided structure, which very likely corresponds to a warped rotating ring, in agreement with previous studies. Our e-EVN observations at 5GHz and complementary archival VLBI data at 5GHz and 8.4GHz, reveal the presence of various milliarcsec compact components in the nucleus of IC883. A single compact source, an AGN candidate, dominates the emission at both nuclear and circumnuclear scales, as imaged with the e-EVN and e-MERLIN, respectively. The other milliarcsec components are very suggestive of ongoing nuclear CCSN activity. Our e-EVN observations also resulted in upper limits to the radio luminosity of the two SNe in IC883 recently discovered at NIR. We refine the classification of SN2011hi as a Type IIP SN according to our latest Gemini-North epoch from 2012, in agreement with a low-luminosity radio SN nature. We estimate a CCSN rate lower limit of 1.1_{-0.6}^{+1.3} yr^{-1} for the entire galaxy, based on three nuclear radio SNe and the circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi. (abridged)',\n",

Mt. Wilson observatory data from 1917 to 1985 are used to analyze the active-region tilt angle as a function of solar cycle, hemisphere, and longitude, in addition to the more common dependence on latitude. Our main results are as follows: i) We recommend a revision of Joys law toward a weaker dependence on latitude (slope of 0.13 to 0.26) and without forcing the tilt to zero at the Equator. ii) We determine that the hemispheric mean tilt value of active regions varies with each solar cycle, although the noise from a stochastic process dominates and does not allow for a determination of the slope of Joys law on an 11-year time scale. iii) The hemispheric difference in mean tilt angles, 1.1 degrees + 0.27, over Cycles 16 to 21 was significant to a three-sigma level, with average tilt angles in the northern and southern hemispheres of 4.7 degrees + 0.26 and 3.6 degrees + 0.27 respectively. iv) Area-weighted mean tilt angles normalized by latitude for Cycles 15 to 21 anticorrelate with cycle strength for the southern hemisphere and whole-Sun data, confirming previous results by Dasi-Espuig, Solanki, Krivova, et al. (2010, Astron. Astrophys. 518, A7). The northern hemispheric mean tilt angles do not show a dependence on cycle strength. vi) Mean tilt angles do not show a dependence on longitude for any hemisphere or cycle.

A spectral index analysis is performed, based on the [OII] and Hdelta features, and the D4000 break, available for more than 100 member galaxies per cluster. Combination of spectral indices and FUV-optical colours provides a picture of the star formation history in galaxies. In spite of the potential presence of a small fraction of galaxies with obscured star formation activity, the average star-formation history of cluster members is found to depend on cluster-centric distance and on substructure. There is a sharp increase in star formation activity along two well-defined filamentary structures of the merging cluster RXCJ0014.3-3022, out to its virial radius and beyond, produced by luminous (L ~ L*) and sub-L* galaxies. Conversely, the regular cool-core cluster RXCJ2308.3-0211 mostly hosts galaxies which either populate the red sequence or are becoming passive.

It is shown that under eikonal approximation the above mentioned equations can be reduced to equations for worldline of the particle and equation of spin of the particle along the worldline.

The other possibility is provided by the Fierz-Pauli framework which is based on the more comfortable to deal with second-order Klein-Gordon equation, but it needs to be supplemented by an auxiliary condition. Although the latter formalism avoids some of the pathologies of the high-order equations, it still remains plagued by some inconsistencies such as the acausal propagation of the wave fronts of the (classical) solutions within an electromagnetic environment. We here suggest a method alternative to the above two that combines their advantages while avoiding the related difficulties. Namely, we suggest one sole strictly $ D^{(j,0)\\\\oplus (0,j)}$ representation specific second-order differential equation, which is derivable from a Lagrangian and whose solutions do not violate causality. The equation under discussion presents itself as the product of the Klein-Gordon operator with a momentum-independent projector on Lorentz irreducible representation spaces constructed from one of the Casimir invariants of the spin-Lorentz group.
