        "title": "e-MERLIN and VLBI observations of the luminous infrared galaxy IC883: a nuclear starburst and an AGN candidate revealed",
        "real_abstract": "The high star formation rates of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) make them ideal places for core-collapse supernova (CCSN) searches. At radio frequencies, free from dust extinction, it is possible to detect compact components within the innermost LIRG nuclear regions, such as SNe and SN remnants, as well as AGN buried deep in the LIRG nuclei. We studied the LIRG IC883 aiming at: (i) investigating its (circum-)nuclear regions using the e-EVN at 5GHz, and e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz, complemented by archival VLBI data; (ii) detecting at radio frequencies the two recently reported circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi, which were discovered by near-IR (NIR) adaptive optics observations of IC883; and (iii) further investigating the nature of SN2011hi at NIR by means of observations with Gemini-North. The circumnuclear regions traced by e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz have an extension of ~1kpc, and show a striking double-sided structure, which very likely corresponds to a warped rotating ring, in agreement with previous studies. Our e-EVN observations at 5GHz and complementary archival VLBI data at 5GHz and 8.4GHz, reveal the presence of various milliarcsec compact components in the nucleus of IC883. A single compact source, an AGN candidate, dominates the emission at both nuclear and circumnuclear scales, as imaged with the e-EVN and e-MERLIN, respectively. The other milliarcsec components are very suggestive of ongoing nuclear CCSN activity. Our e-EVN observations also resulted in upper limits to the radio luminosity of the two SNe in IC883 recently discovered at NIR. We refine the classification of SN2011hi as a Type IIP SN according to our latest Gemini-North epoch from 2012, in agreement with a low-luminosity radio SN nature. We estimate a CCSN rate lower limit of 1.1_{-0.6}^{+1.3} yr^{-1} for the entire galaxy, based on three nuclear radio SNe and the circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi. (abridged)",

The results show that IC883 is a nuclear starburst galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidate. The starburst activity is most likely triggered by the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The AGN is likely to be emitting high-energy photons, which is consistent with the presence of a powerful radio source at the center of the galaxy."

We try to shed light on the uncertainties that are responsible for the span of estimates for Omega_m. We divide the methods into the following four classes: a. Global measures of the properties of space-time that constrain combinations of Omega_m and the other cosmological parameters (Lambda, Ho, to). b. Virialized Systems. Nonlinear dynamics within galaxies and clusters on comoving scales 1-10 Mpc/h. c. Large-scale structure. Mildly-nonlinear gravitational dynamics of fluctuations on scales 10-100 Mpc/h, in particular cosmic flows. d. Growth rate of fluctuations from the last scattering of the CMB or from high redshift galaxies to the present. Methods (b) typically yield low values of Omega_m=0.2-0.3.

At z = 0.0593, this is the third-nearest GRB-SN. Nightly optical spectra obtained with the Magellan telescopes during the first week after explosion reveal the gradual emergence of very broad spectral features superposed on a blue continuum. The supernova features are typical of broad-lined SNe Ic and are generally consistent with previous supernovae associated with low-redshift GRBs. However, the inferred velocities of SN 2010bh at 21 days after explosion are a factor of ~2 times larger than those of the prototypical SN 1998bw at similar epochs, with v ~ 26,000 km/s, indicating a larger explosion energy or a different ejecta structure. A near-infrared spectrum taken 13.8 days after explosion shows no strong evidence for He I at 1.083 microns, implying that the progenitor was largely stripped of its helium envelope. The host galaxy is of low luminosity (M_R ~ -18.5 mag) and low metallicity (Z < 0.4 Z_solar), similar to the hosts of other low-redshift GRB-SNe.",

The new low energy data from STAR complements high statistics data sets at sqrt{s_{NN}} of 62.4 and 200 GeV. Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry allows to determine the size of pion emitting source regions. The dependence of the HBT radius parameters on azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane have been extracted. These dependencies can be related to the freeze out eccentricity. The new results from STAR are consistent with a monotonically decreasing freeze out eccentricity and constrain any minimum, suggested by previously available data, to lie in the range between 11.5 and 39 GeV. Of several models UrQMD appears to best predict the STAR and AGS data.",

        "real_abstract": "We discuss theoretical issues pertaining to baryonic matter in the combined heavy-quark and large $N_c$ limits of QCD. Witten's classic argument that baryons and interacting systems of baryons can be described in a mean-field approximation with each of the quarks moving in an average potential due to the remaining quarks is heuristic. It is important to justify this heuristic description for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting baryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the possibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up the entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful states coupled together to make a color-singlet state. In this work, we provide a formal justification of this heuristic prescription. In order to do this, we start by taking the heavy quark limit, thus effectively reducing the problem to a many-body quantum mechanical system. This problem can be formulated in terms of integrals over coherent states, which for this problem are simple Slater determinants. We show that for the many-body problem, the support region for these integrals becomes narrow at large $N_c$, yielding an energy which is well-approximated by a single coherent state---that is a mean-field description. Corrections to the energy are of relative order $1/N_c$. While hidden color states are present in the exact state of the heavy quark system, they only influence the interaction energy at sub-leading order in $1/N_{c}$.",

Here we show an experimentally significant approximate dynamical effect, namely a vector superposition effect which arises under certain dynamical conditions when we have absolute motion and gravitational in-flows: the velocities for these processes are shown to be approximately vectorially additive under these conditions. This effect plays a key role in interpreting the data from the numerous experiments that detected the absolute linear motion of the earth. The violations of this superposition effect lead to observable effects, such as the generation of turbulence. The flow theory also leads to vorticity effects that the Gravity Probe B gyroscope experiment will soon begin observing. As previously reported General Relativity predicts a smaller vorticity effect (therein called the Lense-Thirring `frame-dragging' effect) than the new theory of gravity.",

The smaller value for r s np , derived from the two most recent n-p total cross section measurements, raises serious difficulties with the hypothesis of charge independence, which are discussed. The prediction includes corrections for the shape dependence of the triplet effective range, the deuteron D state probability, and the intermediate range behaviour of the wave functions, which contribute half the quoted uncertainty; these corrections are model independent to within that uncertainty if the longest range part of the interaction is due to one-pion exchange. The experimental value of 334.2\u00b10.5 mb obtained by Cox, Wynchank and Collie therefore shows an interaction effect of 9.5\u00b11.2% (or 7.7\u00b11.5%). A recently proposed approximation based on dispersion theory which would, if accepted, explain two-thirds of the effect, is shown to be quantitatively inadequate. Hence covariant calculations which reduce to this approximation must be rejected, except for those parts of the calculation which give meson current corrections. Stranahan predicts a 2.9% correction coming from the \u03c0-N 33 resonance, while the calculation of M. H. Skolnick, interpreted as indicated, gives a non-resonant contribution of 2.2%. Even if these effects could be added, a substantial part of the meson current contribution remains unexplained. It is suggested that at least part of this residual effect might be due to the large \u03c0-\u03b3-\u03f1 coupling recently invoked by Adler and Drell to account for the static magnetic moment of the deuteron and the large forward photopion production cross section in the multi-GeV region.",

Radiation from fuzzballs can carry information and does not lead to information loss. But if we let a shell of matter collapse then it creates a horizon, and it seems that subsequent radiation will lead to information loss. We argue that the resolution to this problem is that the shell can tunnel to the fuzzball configurations. The amplitude for tunneling is small because we are relating two macroscopically different configurations, but the number of states that we can tunnel to, given through the Bekenstein entropy, is very large. These small and large numbers can cancel each other, making it possible for the shell to tunnel into fuzzball states before a significant amount of radiation has been emitted. This offers a way to resolve the information paradox.",

The generalised reduction involves allowing gauge potentials in the higher dimension to have an additional linear dependence on the toroidal coordinates.

We consider various examples, including the generalised reduction of M-theory and type II strings on K3, Calabi-Yau and 7-dimensional Joyce manifolds.
