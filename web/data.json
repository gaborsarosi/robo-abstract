    "title": "e-MERLIN and VLBI observations of the luminous infrared galaxy IC883: a nuclear starburst and an AGN candidate revealed.",
    "real_abstract": "The high star formation rates of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) make them ideal places for core-collapse supernova (CCSN) searches. At radio frequencies, free from dust extinction, it is possible to detect compact components within the innermost LIRG nuclear regions, such as SNe and SN remnants, as well as AGN buried deep in the LIRG nuclei. We studied the LIRG IC883 aiming at: (i) investigating its (circum-)nuclear regions using the e-EVN at 5GHz, and e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz, complemented by archival VLBI data; (ii) detecting at radio frequencies the two recently reported circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi, which were discovered by near-IR (NIR) adaptive optics observations of IC883; and (iii) further investigating the nature of SN2011hi at NIR by means of observations with Gemini-North. The circumnuclear regions traced by e-MERLIN at 6.9GHz have an extension of ~1kpc, and show a striking double-sided structure, which very likely corresponds to a warped rotating ring, in agreement with previous studies. Our e-EVN observations at 5GHz and complementary archival VLBI data at 5GHz and 8.4GHz, reveal the presence of various milliarcsec compact components in the nucleus of IC883. A single compact source, an AGN candidate, dominates the emission at both nuclear and circumnuclear scales, as imaged with the e-EVN and e-MERLIN, respectively. The other milliarcsec components are very suggestive of ongoing nuclear CCSN activity. Our e-EVN observations also resulted in upper limits to the radio luminosity of the two SNe in IC883 recently discovered at NIR. We refine the classification of SN2011hi as a Type IIP SN according to our latest Gemini-North epoch from 2012, in agreement with a low-luminosity radio SN nature. We estimate a CCSN rate lower limit of 1.1_{-0.6}^{+1.3} yr^{-1} for the entire galaxy, based on three nuclear radio SNe and the circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi. (abridged)",
    "fake_abstract": " We present the results of three observational campaigns of eVLBI, at the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), in 2001/2002, 2006/2007, and 2009/2010, with the eMERLIN array. These include observations of the luminous infrared galaxy IC883 and two nearby galaxies, with a total of seven frequencies. The results show a strong trend between luminosity of the nuclear regions and the flux observed in all frequencies. The presence of a central brightening at ~1.7 GHz and a power excess at ~8.8 GHz are robustly detected by all instruments. The global morphology of the nuclear region, extending over ~100 pc, is similar for all frequencies, suggesting a single source for the radio emission. A correlation between the radio flux and the SFR of the galaxy at the central position is present for the whole population. In addition, we identify the counterpart of the excess at ~8.8 GHz as the nucleus of IC883, with a SFR that is 2.5 times higher than the average SFR of the galaxy, implying a starbursting nucleus. This is the first VLBI detection of a radio/IR/UV continuum of a starbursting nucleus and also the first detection of a disk-dominated galaxy at radio wavelengths."

    "real_abstract": "We were asked to debate the value of the cosmological mass-density parameter Omega. Is Omega_m=1 in accordance with the simplest model? Is Omega_m much smaller as indicated by some observations? There is conflicting evidence. We lay out the various methods for measuring Omega_m, mention new developments and current estimates, and focus on prospects versus the associated difficulties. We try to shed light on the uncertainties that are responsible for the span of estimates for Omega_m. We divide the methods into the following four classes: a. Global measures of the properties of space-time that constrain combinations of Omega_m and the other cosmological parameters (Lambda, Ho, to). b. Virialized Systems. Nonlinear dynamics within galaxies and clusters on comoving scales 1-10 Mpc/h. c. Large-scale structure. Mildly-nonlinear gravitational dynamics of fluctuations on scales 10-100 Mpc/h, in particular cosmic flows. d. Growth rate of fluctuations from the last scattering of the CMB or from high redshift galaxies to the present. Methods (b) typically yield low values of Omega_m=0.2-0.3. Methods (a) and (c) typically indicate higher values of Omega_m=0.4-1.",
    "fake_abstract": " There are two ways to measure omega, the accuracy with which we specify the value of this parameter, and the precision of the predictions we can make with the help of our particular value of omega. Much of the standard work on n-couplings turned out to be almost totally irrelevant to the three-gluon approach. The three-gluon approach has a parameter omega, which translates three-gluons into the quark-antiquark framework. In our approach, omega affects the strength of gluons $ \\alpha$ and $ \\beta$ , which in turn determine the location of the binding energy. We consider only two values of omega, $ \\alpha = \\pm 2$ and $ \\alpha = 0 $ . We make some predictions for the three-gluon energies for various values of $ \\alpha = \\pm 2$ . We also make some predictions for the strengths of $ \\alpha$ for various values of $ \\alpha = 0 $ . We also discuss the possibility that omega may be a construction parameter, which is set to a large value in order to ensure a small renormalization in a renormalization group expansion. We argue that these possibilities are not mutually exclusive. "

    "real_abstract": "We present the spectroscopic discovery of a broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN 2010bh) associated with the nearby long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 100316D. At z = 0.0593, this is the third-nearest GRB-SN. Nightly optical spectra obtained with the Magellan telescopes during the first week after explosion reveal the gradual emergence of very broad spectral features superposed on a blue continuum. The supernova features are typical of broad-lined SNe Ic and are generally consistent with previous supernovae associated with low-redshift GRBs. However, the inferred velocities of SN 2010bh at 21 days after explosion are a factor of ~2 times larger than those of the prototypical SN 1998bw at similar epochs, with v ~ 26,000 km/s, indicating a larger explosion energy or a different ejecta structure. A near-infrared spectrum taken 13.8 days after explosion shows no strong evidence for He I at 1.083 microns, implying that the progenitor was largely stripped of its helium envelope. The host galaxy is of low luminosity (M_R ~ -18.5 mag) and low metallicity (Z < 0.4 Z_solar), similar to the hosts of other low-redshift GRB-SNe.",

The spectrum of SN 2010bh provides direct evidence that the blue-shifted ionization state in this object is Fe xxv, and not the previously favored Fe xxii, which is supported by the absorption lines. The spectrum also contains He i, He ii, and the Fe ii bandhead lines. We estimate the ionization mass of SN 2010bh to be (7.4 - 8.4) 10^-12 solar masses, which is similar to that for the low-ionization phase of SN2007cy (7.4 - 8.1) 10^-12 solar masses. This mass difference confirms the calibration of the peak of Fe ii lines as a function of ionization state obtained from the spectroscopic survey of SN 2007cy. The spectrum also reveals the presence of H 2 and C 2 in the spectrum of SN 2010bh, which is not well-known for type Ic explosions and can be used as a tracer of the circumstellar matter. A comparison with the spectrum of the progenitor star of SN 2010bh shows that the low energy component of the spectrum is consistent with the ionized envelope of SN 2010bh, while the higher energy component is consistent with the circumstellar matter and the circumstellar envelope of the progenitor.

We briefly describe physics topics related to cosmology, such as indirect searches for supersymmetric cold dark matter, for slow and relativistic magnetic monopoles, GZK neutrinos and violation of Lorentz invariance or Equivalence Principle.

This provides a huge volume for cosmological neutrino detection, and hence the possibility to understand the role of neutrinos in galaxy formation, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the acceleration of cosmic ray particles in galactic environments. We present a brief review of the present status of cosmological neutrino observations and discuss some of the most promising future prospects and possibilities. We conclude by reviewing some of the open issues that remain and discuss some ideas for how IceCube, by complementing and expanding on existing cosmological dark matter observations, can play its part in forming a complete picture of the origin and evolution of the universe."

Thus supersymmetric solutions of the leading term can be written as a sum of solutions of the ordinary leading term and of solutions of the supersymmetric Pauli-matrix method.

The role of the duality is to show that a certain generic spacetime prescription can be understood equally well as 3D or 4D action, thereby accounting for the consistency of the 4D effective field theory. A spacetime quantum field theory is algebraically equivalent to a spacetime action functional on a C3 space. The 3D action is then the Seiberg-Pedersen duality. The 4D action can be constructed as a Seiberg-Pedersen duality between a geometry whose holonomy is given by the 4D action and a diffeomorphism which can be understood as a 4D action with new variables. The 4D action can be understood as a Seiberg-Pedersen duality between an algebra over the gauge group of a space and an action which makes the space conformally invariant. The connection between the 3D and 4D actions is the Seiberg-Pedersen duality between a diffeomorphism and its associated 3D action. "

The recent RHIC Beam Energy Scan at sqrt{s_{NN}} of 7.7, 11.5, and 39 GeV provide an opportunity to explore the energy dependence of the freeze out eccentricity. The new low energy data from STAR complements high statistics data sets at sqrt{s_{NN}} of 62.4 and 200 GeV. Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry allows to determine the size of pion emitting source regions. The dependence of the HBT radius parameters on azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane have been extracted. These dependencies can be related to the freeze out eccentricity. The new results from STAR are consistent with a monotonically decreasing freeze out eccentricity and constrain any minimum, suggested by previously available data, to lie in the range between 11.5 and 39 GeV. Of several models UrQMD appears to best predict the STAR and AGS data.",

The freeze out eccentricity, ε = 2βHBT /H, as a function of azimuthal angle is shown for the first time for this data set. The dependence exhibits a large and unexplained dip at 60° that is evident in the full data set but not in the first two runs. The dip is clearly present in both the spin and the parity data, although the dip has a different amplitude in both cases. The dip can be reproduced by assuming a dipolar freeze-out interaction that is small in energy and that significantly enhances the dipolar response."

    "real_abstract": "We discuss theoretical issues pertaining to baryonic matter in the combined heavy-quark and large $N_c$ limits of QCD. Witten's classic argument that baryons and interacting systems of baryons can be described in a mean-field approximation with each of the quarks moving in an average potential due to the remaining quarks is heuristic. It is important to justify this heuristic description for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting baryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the possibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up the entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful states coupled together to make a color-singlet state. In this work, we provide a formal justification of this heuristic prescription. In order to do this, we start by taking the heavy quark limit, thus effectively reducing the problem to a many-body quantum mechanical system. This problem can be formulated in terms of integrals over coherent states, which for this problem are simple Slater determinants. We show that for the many-body problem, the support region for these integrals becomes narrow at large $N_c$, yielding an energy which is well-approximated by a single coherent state---that is a mean-field description. Corrections to the energy are of relative order $1/N_c$. While hidden color states are present in the exact state of the heavy quark system, they only influence the interaction energy at sub-leading order in $1/N_{c}$.",

The baryon effective coupling constant c ϕ is defined as the ratio of the mass of the axial-vector quark ϕ to the mass of the tetraquark ϕ c , where ϕ is the gluon and ϕ c is the tetraquark. This coupling constant can be evaluated by using the renormalization group approach for the gluon operator and the matrix element of the tetraquark operator. We compare our results with recent effective field-theory based calculations in the heavy quark mass region up to the three-quark scale. "

Here we show an experimentally significant approximate dynamical effect, namely a vector superposition effect which arises under certain dynamical conditions when we have absolute motion and gravitational in-flows: the velocities for these processes are shown to be approximately vectorially additive under these conditions. This effect plays a key role in interpreting the data from the numerous experiments that detected the absolute linear motion of the earth. The violations of this superposition effect lead to observable effects, such as the generation of turbulence. The flow theory also leads to vorticity effects that the Gravity Probe B gyroscope experiment will soon begin observing. As previously reported General Relativity predicts a smaller vorticity effect (therein called the Lense-Thirring `frame-dragging' effect) than the new theory of gravity.",

We present a simple prescription for computing the dynamical spacetime curvature induced by the VSE and we show how this curvature leads to a cosmological constant with a negative value of the four-momentum. Finally, we discuss open questions and remaining challenges for implementing the VSE in the in-flow picture of gravity. The results are expected to have a significant impact on our understanding of the present day and future accelerated Universe, on the cosmological constant, and also on the task of building accelerated-universe models.

The smaller value for r s np , derived from the two most recent n-p total cross section measurements, raises serious difficulties with the hypothesis of charge independence, which are discussed. The prediction includes corrections for the shape dependence of the triplet effective range, the deuteron D state probability, and the intermediate range behaviour of the wave functions, which contribute half the quoted uncertainty; these corrections are model independent to within that uncertainty if the longest range part of the interaction is due to one-pion exchange. The experimental value of 334.2±0.5 mb obtained by Cox, Wynchank and Collie therefore shows an interaction effect of 9.5±1.2% (or 7.7±1.5%). A recently proposed approximation based on dispersion theory which would, if accepted, explain two-thirds of the effect, is shown to be quantitatively inadequate. Hence covariant calculations which reduce to this approximation must be rejected, except for those parts of the calculation which give meson current corrections. Stranahan predicts a 2.9% correction coming from the π-N 33 resonance, while the calculation of M. H. Skolnick, interpreted as indicated, gives a non-resonant contribution of 2.2%. Even if these effects could be added, a substantial part of the meson current contribution remains unexplained.

But if we let a shell of matter collapse then it creates a horizon, and it seems that subsequent radiation will lead to information loss. We argue that the resolution to this problem is that the shell can tunnel to the fuzzball configurations. The amplitude for tunneling is small because we are relating two macroscopically different configurations, but the number of states that we can tunnel to, given through the Bekenstein entropy, is very large. These small and large numbers can cancel each other, making it possible for the shell to tunnel into fuzzball states before a significant amount of radiation has been emitted. This offers a way to resolve the information paradox.",

The generalised reduction involves allowing gauge potentials in the higher dimension to have an additional linear dependence on the toroidal coordinates. In this paper, we show that a much wider class of generalised reductions is possible, in which higher-dimensional potentials have additional terms involving differential forms on the internal manifold whose exterior derivatives yield representatives of certain of its cohomology classes. We consider various examples, including the generalised reduction of M-theory and type II strings on K3, Calabi-Yau and 7-dimensional Joyce manifolds.

By keeping all pressure terms, the standard formalisms of rotation curve and gravitational lensing observations are extended to a first post-Newtonian order. It turns out that both post-Newtonian formalisms encode the gravitational field differently. Therefore, combined observations of rotation curves and gravitational lensing of the same galaxy can in principle be used to infer both the density and pressure profile of the galactic fluid. The newly introduced post-Newtonian formalism might allow us to make inferences about the equation of state of dark matter. While the Cold Dark Matter paradigm is currently favoured in the astrophysics and cosmology communities, the formalism presented herein offers an unprecedented way of being able to directly observe the equation of state. In a logically distinct analysis, I investigate the effects of negative pressure in compact objects, motivated by the recently introduced gravastar model. I find that gravastar like objects can in principle mimic the external gravitational field of a black hole. Unlike a black hole, however, gravastars neither exhibit a pathological curvature singularity at the origin nor do they posess an event horizon.

Here we give the redshifts of 334 galaxies in these redshift-space neighborhoods. For completeness, we also give the redshifts of the 232 original members. These data include 199 new redshifts.

Each point in the data is analyzed by inversion of the system of equations: 1) f(z) = 0, with initial conditions f(0) = 1. 2) g(t) = 4.1, with initial conditions g(0) = 1. 3) e(t) = -1, with initial conditions g(0) = 1.

We show that the infinite-size corrections to the unitary Weyl and to the Chern-Simons terms are given by the same expressions and that the orders of the vector potentials are unchanged by the finite-size corrections. We also study the density of the critical density of a regular solid and we obtain a new estimate of the critical density of a critical solid in the one-parameter Floquet model.

Eventhough the formulation is intrinsically non-perturbative, we have shown that a loop-expansion can be implemented. As illustrative examples, we apply our formulation on the $\\Phi^{4}$ theory and an extended Lee model. The many-body problem in an extended Lee model is also studied. We show that a combination of the coupled-cluster theory and the Feshbach projection techniques leads to a renormalized generalized Brueckner theory.

In this part, we will employ an effective field-theoretical model as can be constructed by means of the techniques of the first part of the thesis, a quark-confining non-local NJL model and study the baryon and diquarks in this model. After truncation of the two-body channels to the scalar and axial-vector diquarks, a relativistic Faddeev equation for nucleon bound states is solved in the covariant diquark-quark picture.

Although such optimism has been challenged by the recent surprising discovery of the insecurity of the so-called quantum bit commitment, the security of quantum two-party computation itself remains unaddressed. Here we answer this question directly by showing that all ``one-sided'' two-party computations (which allow only one of the two parties to learn the result) are necessarily insecure. As corollaries to our results, quantum oblivious password identification and the so-called quantum one-out-of-two oblivious transfer are impossible. We also construct a class of functions that cannot be computed securely in any ``two-sided'' two-party computation. Nevertheless, quantum cryptography remains useful in key distribution and can still provide partial security in ``quantum money'' proposed by Wiesner.",

    "real_abstract": "Context: We integrate the 2D MHD ideal equations of a straight slab to simulate observational results associated with fundamental sausage trapped modes. Aims: Starting from a non-equilibrium state with a dense chromospheric layer, we analyse the evolution of the internal plasma dynamics of magnetic loops, subject to line-tying boundary conditions, and with the coronal parameters described in Asai et al. (2001) and Melnikov et al. (2002) to investigate the onset and damping of sausage modes. Methods: To integrate the equations we used a high resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) method specially designed to deal appropriately with flow discontinuities. Results: Due to non-linearities and inhomogeneities, pure modes are difficult to sustain and always occur coupled among them so as to satisfy, e.g., the line-tying constraint. We found that, in one case, the resonant coupling of the sausage fundamental mode with a slow one results in a non-dissipative damping of the former. Conclusions: In scenarios of thick and dense loops, where the analytical theory predicts the existence of fundamental trapped sausage modes, the coupling of fast and slow quasi-periodic modes -with a node at the center of the longitudinal speed- occur contributing to the damping of the fast mode. If a discontinuity in the total pressure between the loop and the corona is assumed, a fundamental fast sausage transitory leaky regime is spontaneously produced and an external compressional Alfv\\'en wave takes away the magnetic energy.",

This is of interest in two aspects: First, if there is a statistical association this can be another piece of evidence showing that various meteorological observables indeed respond to variations in the interplanetary environment. Second, this can be a very crucial observational constraint since most models proposed so far are expected to preferentially work in higher latitude regions than the low latitude region studied here. We have examined daily solar wind speed ${\\rm V}$, daily SLP difference ${\\rm \\Delta SLP}$, and daily ${\\rm \\log(BV^{2})}$ using the superposed epoch analysis in which the key date is set such that the daily solar wind speed exceeds 800 ${\\rm kms^{-1}}$.

The amount of positive deviation of ${\\rm \\Delta SLP}$ is +2.5 hPa. The duration of deviation is a few days.

Based on interplanetary magnetic field measurements, we find the following features. The arrival of the high-speed solar-wind-driven meteoroid at 2.11 solar radii on February 15, 1991 was associated with a distinct increase of sea-level pressure of 22 hPa at Seoul. Immediately after the event, interplanetary magnetic field strengths in the southward direction at both magnetic observatories are significantly modified, which is interpreted as the result of a strong magnetic convection induced by the passage of the magnetically-caught solar-wind-driven meteoroid. The arrival of the high-speed solar-wind-driven meteoroid at 3.2 solar radii on February 26, 2008 was not associated with any noticeable change in sea-level pressure over South Korea, which may be reflected by the relatively weak magnetic field in this area. Based on the modified interplanetary magnetic field strength, the arrival of the high-speed solar-wind-driven meteoroid at 3.2 solar radii on February 26, 2008 should have been accompanied by penetration of Earth's magnetosphere into the magnetotail. Such a penetration may be confirmed by observations at the New Comprehensive Proportional Spectrometer (NSPS) on board of SOHO. "

    "title": "The Clump Mass Function of the Dense Clouds in the Carina Nebula.",
    "real_abstract": "Stars form in dense, cold regions of dust and gas, called Molecular Clouds. The question how the initial conditions in these star-forming regions affect the resulting mass function of the forming stars is one of the most fundamental open problems in the theory of star formation. Therefore in this work we want to characterize the properties of the cold cloud structures in the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372). The Carina Nebula represents with a distance of 2.3 kpc one of the nearest massive Galactic star forming regions, hosting at least 65 O-type stars. Therefore it is the best site to study in detail the physics of violent massive star formation. The feedback of the numerous hot stars disperses the parental cloud but also triggers the formation of new generations of stars. We use a $1.25^{\\rm{o}} \\times 1.25^{\\rm{o}}$ wide-field sub-millimetre map of the Carina Nebula obtained with LABOCA (870$\\mu$m) at the APEX telescope to investigate its Clump Mass Function (ClMF). New deeper LABOCA maps of two selected regions experiencing different levels of stellar feedback will allow, due to their higher sensitivity, a more complete look on the cloud structures and the influence of the hot stars. To determine the ClMF of the Carina Nebula we use the three common clump-finding algorithms CLUMPFIND, GAUSSCLUMPS, and SExtractor. Each of these programs leads to a sample of clumps, whose positions, sizes, and intensities are calculated. For a reliable mass estimate the knowledge about the temperatures within the clumps is very important. In addition to the commonly used approach to assume a ”typical” temperature for all clouds, we derive an empirical relation between cloud column density and temperature to determine an estimate of the individual clump temperatures. For all three samples we find clump temperatures between 8.5 K and 18.5 K. With these temperatures we are able to determine the individual clump masses. For masses above ∼ 50 M$_{\\odot}$ we find a power-law for all three ClMFs, with a power-law index $\\alpha$ of about 1.9. This is in good agreement with observations of ClMFs in other star-forming regions. For an assumed constant temperature for all clumps the power-law slope steepens. However, the GAUSSCLUMPS and SExtractor samples can also be well described by a log-normal function. Theoretical models predict a log-normal shaped ClMF for turbulent pre-stellar clouds, whereas the ClMFs of star-forming clouds should follow a power-law. But as we find that the resulting ClMF shape depends highly on the employed extraction method, such interpretations based on the shape of the ClMF may be taken with care if no additional information is available.",

The H$_{\\gamma}$ peak is located at approximately 5500 Å, which is consistent with the peak emission line position of the H$_{\\gamma}$ emission line. We also obtain a mass function that can be well fitted with a power-law function for the molecular clouds of the Carina Nebula. The derived mass function is different from that derived from the ionized gas with a slope of 1.00 ± 0.04. This leads to the conclusion that the molecular clouds are mostly composed of molecular material. Our mass function derived from the H$_{\\gamma}$ emission line is in agreement with the mass function derived from the optical H$_{\\gamma}$ line widths at 3.6 and 6.6 Å (1.96 M$_{\\odot}$ and 2.72 M$_{\\odot}$, respectively). Our mass function derived from the molecular H$_{\\gamma}$ emission line width is also in agreement with the mass function of the molecular clouds derived from the chemical abundance ratio of the Carina Nebula at z=0 and z=1.5.

Thus, their data, if repeated with sufficient statistics, support the existence of a large population of primordial planets.

We propose a simple particle physics model in which the DM is a scalar X, with a coupling lambda_X X^2|S|^2 to a scalar multiplet S carrying electric charge, which allows for XX -> gamma gamma at one loop due to the virtual S. We predict a second monochromatic photon peak at 114 GeV due to XX-> gamma Z. The S is colored under a hidden sector SU(N) or QCD to help boost the XX -> gamma gamma cross section. The analogous coupling lambda_h h^2 |S|^2 to the Higgs boson can naturally increase the partial width for h -> gamma gamma by an amount comparable to its standard model value, as suggested by recent measurements from CMS. Due to the hidden sector SU(N) (or QCD), S binds to its antiparticle to form S-mesons, which will be pair-produced in colliders and then decay predominantly to XX, hh, or to glueballs of the SU(N) which subsequently decay to photons.

Given an underlying Sersic dark matter profile, we study whether an NFW profile can provide an acceptable fit to strong lensing constraints in the form of single or multiple measured Einstein radii. We conclude that although an NFW profile that fits the lensing constraints can be found in many cases, the derived parameters may be biased. In particular, we find that for n~2, which corresponds to massive clusters, the mass at r_200 of the best fit NFW is overestimated (by a factor of ~2) and the concentration is very low (c~2). The differences are important enough to warrant the inclusion of Sersic profile for future analysis of strong lensing clusters.",

The two profiles are compared to discover how well they explain the observed lensing statistics. We find that the NFW profile reproduces the strong lensing behavior better than the Sersic profile. The difference between the two profiles is found to be statistically significant. It is explained as a difference in the shape of the extrapolation power-law index of the Sersic profile and the one of the NFW profile. Also, a possible reason for this difference is found to be the presence of a halo component of the mass function of the lensing objects."

We suggest that the main problem of most previous theoretical studies to their inability to fully include electron correlation effects in the atomic structure calculations, while any deficiencies in the scattering approximation methods are of minor importance, regardless of it being close-coupling (CC) or distorted-wave (DW). An approximate method based on the many-body perturbation theory and DW approximation is proposed to include such correlation effects in the calculation of collisional excitation cross sections. The results are shown to agree with coronal observations and laboratory measurements better than most previous theories. Using the new atomic data, we then investigate the electron density sensitivity of the M2/3G intensity ratio and provide an improved density diagnostic tool for astrophysical observations.",

In order to study the spin dependence, we needed to form and polarize muonic 3 He and in the same volume detect the 1.9 MeV tritons created in the reaction. Furthermore, the recoil direction of the tritons had to be determined. The apparatus served both as a polarized target and as a detector. The detector, a gridded ion chamber, was incorporated inside a 51 polarized target that was filled with 8 atm of 3 He and 100 Torr of N 2 and rubidium metal. At the operating temperature of the device (205–230°C) the rubidium number density was approximately 10 15 atoms/cm 3 . Muons that stopped in the target formed muonic helium atoms, which were then polarized by collisions with optically pumped Rb vapor. Two high-powered GaAlAs diode laser arrays were used to polarize the Rb in the 100 cm 3 fiducial volume located inside the ion chamber. The ion chamber produced clean signals from the reaction tritons despite having to operate under the extreme conditions required for efficient optical pumping. The direction of the tritons was determined by analyzing the shapes of the ionization pulses. The muon polarization was measured using the decay electron asymmetry.",

The radio images show systematic variability in the Crab's radio emission throughout the region near the pulsar. The principal geometry of the variable features is that of elliptical ripples very similar to the optical wisps. The radio wisps are seen to move systematically outward with projected speeds of up to 0.3c. Comparing the new radio images to our earlier ones from 1998 and 2000, we show there are also more slowly moving features somewhat farther away from the pulsar. In particular, there is a prominent moving feature to the northwest of the pulsar which has a projected speed of order 10,000 km/s. Striation is seen throughout the nebula, suggesting the presence of wave-like disturbances propagating through the synchrotron bubble. The radio images were taken simultaneously with HST optical observations. Comparing the radio to the optical images, we find that the radio wisps are sometimes displaced from the optical ones or have no optical counterparts. We also find that some optical wisps in particular, the brightest optical wisps near the pulsar, do not seem to have radio counterparts. In the exterior of the nebula, by contrast, there is generally a good correspondence between the radio and optical features.",

The emission at low frequencies, characteristic of the pre-breakup population of OB stars, is completely absent in the bright rim. Within the region, H I emission is also found in a large extended molecular cloud just outside the nucleus. The unprecedentedly large amount of molecular gas in the very extended region of the pre-breakup population is accounted for by the presence of a large dark molecular cloud which is resolved in the radio image. Its location is traced by radio emission in the H I radio map, and is suggested to be the center of the radio continuum emission. The H I emission is also found in the region located south of the bright rim, where an enhanced star formation activity occurs, whose radio continuum emission is traced by radio emission in the H I radio map. The remarkably large size of the extended H I cloud is accounted for by the presence of this large dark molecular cloud south of the bright rim. This conclusion is supported by optical observations.

We compare a recently proposed model of semiclassical black hole evaporation to the two established models. In particular, we study the density matrix of the outgoing radiation and determine how the magnitude of the off-diagonal corrections differs for the three frameworks. For Hawking’s model, we find power-law corrections to the two-point functions that induce exponentially suppressed corrections to the off-diagonal elements of the full density matrix. This verifies that the Hawking result is correct to all orders in perturbation theory and also allows one to express the full density matrix in terms of the single-particle density matrix. We then consider the semiclassical theory for which the corrections, being non-perturbative from an effective field-theory perspective, are much less suppressed and grow monotonically in time. In this case, the Rényi entropy for the outgoing radiation is shown to grow linearly at early times, but this growth slows down and the entropy eventually starts to decrease at the Page time. In addition to comparing models, we emphasize the distinction between the state of the radiation emitted from a black hole, which is highly quantum, and that of the radiation emitted from a typical classical black body at the same temperature.",

We use the STOKES radiative transfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the geometry of the scattering region. If correct, then this model resolves the long-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the inflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the outer accretion disk and that similar magnetohydrodynamic processes are operating. In the scattering model, the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts, as is observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad absorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from the BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line profiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.",

Using the Einstein-de Sitter wave equation we show that the azimuthal distribution of broad-line widths and the correlation between broad-lines observed in active galaxies and the local distribution of broad-lines in galaxies can be understood in terms of the in-fall of a broad-line region into a galaxy. A simple explanation of a correlation between the photo-ionized gas' disk and the broad-line region (<=200 kpc) predicts that broad-lines should be preferentially found in the great-circle plane of an image of an AGN, and that their inner position in the galactic plane should be directly related to the in-fall velocity.

Using high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we isolate the impact of AGN feedback on the Lx-Tx relation, testing the two archetypal and common regimes, self-regulated mechanical feedback and a quasar thermal blast. We find that AGN feedback has severe difficulty in breaking the relation in a consistent way. The similarity breaking is directly linked to the gas evacuation within R500, while the central cooling times are inversely proportional to the core density. Breaking self-similarity thus implies breaking the cool core, morphing all systems to non-cool-core objects, which is in clear contradiction with the observed data populated by several cool-core systems. Self-regulated feedback, which quenches cooling flows and preserves cool cores, prevents dramatic evacuation and similarity breaking at any scale; the relation scatter is also limited. The impulsive thermal blast can break the core-included Lx-Tx at T500 1 keV, but substantially empties and overheats the halo, generating a perennial non-cool-core group, as experienced by cosmological simulations. Even with partial evacuation, massive systems remain overheated. We show that the action of purely AGN feedback is to lower the luminosity and heat the gas, perpendicular to the fit.",

Our analysis indicates that when the feedback from clusters to groups is taken into account, the galaxy luminosity function is not significantly affected by feedback from groups to galaxies. When feedback from groups to galaxies is taken into account, the feedback from clusters to groups has a mild effect on the galaxy luminosity function."

We derived effective temperatures, luminosities, surface gravities, surface abundances, mass-loss rates, wind terminal velocities, and clumping filling factors. The supergiants define a very clear evolutionary sequence, in terms of ages and masses, from younger and more massive stars to older stars with lower initial masses. O4 supergiants cluster around the 3 Myr isochrone and are more massive than 60 Msun, while the O5 to O7.5 stars have masses in the range 50 - 40 Msun and are 4 +/- 0.3 Myr old. The surface chemical composition is typical of evolved O supergiants (nitrogen-rich, carbon- and oxygen-poor). While the observed ranges of carbon and nitrogen mass-fractions are compatible with those expected from evolutionary models for the measured stellar masses, the N/C ratios as a function of age are inconsistent with the theoretical predictions for the four earliest (O4 spectral type) stars of the sample. We question the efficiency of rotational mixing as a function of age for these stars and suggest that another mechanism may be needed to explain the observed abundance patterns. Mass-loss rates derived with clumped-models range within a factor of three of the theoretical mass-loss rates. The corresponding volume-filling factors associated with small-scale clumping are 0.05 +/- 0.02. Clumping is found to start close to the photosphere for all but three stars, two of which are fast rotators.",

We have isolated the O-supergiant candidates using the UV excess and the [FeII]{alpha} emission line ratio between stars at least a factor of two fainter than the Palomar-Green survey stars. The identified O-supergiant stars are confirmed to be giants, and follow a previously derived trend of increasing [FeII]{alpha} emission line ratio with increasing luminosity. The detection of the [FeII] line also provides information on the intrinsic UV luminosity of the candidate. The UV luminosity is found to be 842 +/- 16 solar luminosities (sul) for the O-supergiant stars and 516 +/- 7 sul for the field dwarfs. These results are confirmed by examining the optical colors of the O-supergiant candidates. We have determined the accurate colors of the O-supergiant candidates using the UCAC2, UCAC3, and SDSS catalogues. We have found that the colors of the O-supergiant candidates are well calculated. Among the O-supergiant candidates, the tightly defined and reddest O-supergiant candidates, selected as the candidates having a color excess brighter than 0.3 dex, are found to be hotter and more luminous than the Sun. The O-supergiant candidates with the reddest colors appear to be the youngest with ages ranging from 100 to 200 Myr. They are mainly located in the Galactic disk, and our results show that about two-thirds of the O-supergiant candidates are located in regions close to the Sun. "

    "title": "Kinetic helicity needed to drive large-scale dynamos.",
    "real_abstract": "Magnetic field generation on scales that are large compared with the scale of the turbulent eddies is known to be possible via the so-called α effect when the turbulence is helical and if the domain is large enough for the α effect to dominate over turbulent diffusion. Using three-dimensional turbulence simulations, we show that the energy of the resulting mean magnetic field of the saturated state increases linearly with the product of normalized helicity and the ratio of domain scale to eddy scale, provided this product exceeds a critical value of around unity. This implies that large-scale dynamo action commences when the normalized helicity is larger than the inverse scale ratio. Our results show that the emergence of small-scale dynamo action does not have any noticeable effect on the large-scale dynamo. Recent findings by Pietarila Graham [Phys. Rev. EPLEEE81539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.85.066406 85, 066406 (2012)] of a smaller minimal helicity may be an artifact due to the onset of small-scale dynamo action at large magnetic Reynolds numbers. However, the onset of large-scale dynamo action is difficult to establish when the kinetic helicity is small. Instead of random forcing, they used an ABC flow with time-dependent phases. We show that such dynamos saturate prematurely in a way that is reminiscent of inhomogeneous dynamos with internal magnetic helicity fluxes. Furthermore, even for very low fractional helicities, such dynamos display large-scale fields that change direction, which is uncharacteristic of turbulent dynamos.",

For leading order in the loop length, the helicity-frequency dependence of the loop's helicity-average energy spectrum is found to be explained solely by the mass of the axial current, as this determines the source of the dynamo helicity.

The regression slope in the flux-flux space of a quasar light curve directly measures the color of the flux difference spectrum, then the spectral shape of the flux difference spectra can be derived by taking a careful look at the redshift dependence of the regression slopes. First, we confirm that the observed quasar spectrum becomes bluer when the quasar becomes brighter. We infer the spectral index of the composite difference spectrum as (in the form of ), which is significantly bluer than that of the composite spectrum . We also show that the continuum variability cannot be explained by accretion disk models with varying mass accretion rates. Second, we examine the effects of broad emission line variability on the color-redshift space. The variability of the \"Small Blue Bump\" is extensively discussed. We show that the low-ionization lines of Mg II and Fe II are less variable compared to Balmer emission lines and high-ionization lines, and the Balmer continuum is the dominant variable source around ~3000 Å.

An initial rotation curve, RC0, is adopted from an observed PV diagram (PV0), obtained by any simple method such as the peak-intensity method. Using this rotation curve and an observed radial distribution of intensity (emissivity), we construct a simulated PV diagram (PV1). The difference between a rotation curve obtained from this PV1 and the original RC (e.g., difference between peak-intensity velocities) is used to correct the initial RC to obtain a corrected rotation curve, RC1. This RC1 is used to calculated another PVD (PV2) using the observed intensity distribution, and to obtain the second iterated RC (RC2). This iteration is repeated until PV$i$ converges to PV0, so that the differences between PV$i$ and PV0 becomes minimum. Finally RC$i$ is adopted as the most reliable rotation curve. We apply this method to some observed PVDs of nearby galaxies, and show that the iteration successfully converges to give reliable rotation curves. We show that the method is powerful to detect central massive objects.",

We develop a framework for studying the formation and stability of runaway stars by calculating the effects of magnetic fields near the stellar surface and near the Roche limit. In particular, we show that the presence of a significant magnetic field can stabilize a runaway star in an isolated region in the Galaxy if its distance from the central cluster exceeds a critical value, and thus, not be subject to violent disruption during its migration away from the cluster.

We wish to search for dark-matter halos through weak-lensing signatures which are significantly above the random and systematic noise level caused by intervening large-scale structures. We employ a linear matched filter which maximises the signal-to-noise ratio by minimising the number of spurious detections caused by the superposition of large-scale structures (LSS). This is achieved by suppressing those spatial frequencies dominated by the LSS contamination. We confirm the improved stability and reliability of the detections achieved with our new filter compared to the commonly-used aperture mass (Schneider, 1996: Schneider et al., 1998) and to the aperture mass based on the shear profile expected for NFW haloes (see e.g. Schirmer et al., 2004: Hennawi & Spergel, 2005). Schirmer et al.~(2006) achieved results comparable to our filter, but probably only because of the low average redshift of the background sources in GaBoDS, which keeps the LSS contamination low. For deeper data, the difference will be more important, as shown by Maturi et al. (2005). We detect fourteen halos on about eighteen square degrees selected from the survey. Five are known clusters, two are associated with over-densities of galaxies visible in the GaBoDS image, and seven have no known optical or X-ray counterparts.",

This is because we find that the distribution of events with best-fit mass-to-luminosity profile is not well described by a power-law distribution. The peak mass (both in the median and the mass-to-luminosity ratio) is also inconsistent with a power law.

    "real_abstract": "We discuss a model of cosmic ray acceleration that accounts for the observations of anomalous cosmic rays by Voyager 1 and 2. The model appeals to fast magnetic reconnection rather than shocks as the driver of acceleration. The ultimate source of energy is associated with magnetic field reversals that occur in the heliosheath. It is expected that the magnetic field reversals will occur throughout the heliosheath, but especially near the heliopause where the flows slows down and diverge in respect to the interstellar wind and also in the boundary sector-in the heliospheric current sheet. While the First Order Fermi acceleration theory within reconnection layers is in its infancy, the available predictions do not contradict the available data on anomalous cosmic ray spectra measured by the spacecrafts. We argue that the Voyager data can be one of the first pieces of evidence favoring the acceleration within regions of fast magnetic reconnection, which we argue is a widely spread astrophysical process.",

For all luminosity ranges and environments considered the colour distributions are well described by the sum of two Gaussian functions. We find that the fraction of galaxies in the red sequence is an increasing function of group virial mass. We also study the evolution of the galaxy colour distributions at low redshift, $z\\le0.18$ in the field and in groups for galaxies brighter than $M_r-5\\log(h)=-20$, finding significant evidence of recent evolution in the population of galaxies in groups. The fraction of red galaxies monotonically increases with decreasing redshift, this effect implies a much stronger evolution of galaxies in groups than in the field.",
    "fake_abstract": " We make use of the large sample of galaxies in SDSS Group I to study the evolution of the bi-modal colour distribution of galaxies with group size. We find that the colour distributions of galaxies remain almost unchanged in the group sample when we look at the colour distributions of systems at different group sizes. At the same time, we find that the richest subsample of groups with a large fraction of blue galaxies has a colour-magnitude relation which is shifted towards the red end by about a magnitude. We find a mild correlation between the average colours of the richest subsample and the average colours of all galaxies in the group. Our results suggest that the general shape of the colour-magnitude relation is very sensitive to the properties of the galaxies in groups of different sizes. With this caveat in mind, we argue that the distribution of galaxies with one colour and the distribution of galaxies with two colours reveal similar trends over the range of group sizes in this sample. The magnitude-shift of galaxies in the richest subsample of groups with blue galaxies is not sufficient to explain the secular trend of the colour-magnitude relation of nearby galaxies in this sample. We suggest that the broad- band (i.e. blue) galaxies must be in a redder environment than the authors of previous surveys are traditionally assuming. We suggest that this redder environment is composed of an enhanced population of red galaxies in groups, with some of them being red galaxies which have absorbed blue members in groups."

In particular, a double scaling limit of the Gross-Witten one-plaquette lattice model gives the SU(2) Seiberg-Witten solution, including its induced gravitational corrections. Secondly, we point out that the effective superpotential terms for N=1 ADE quiver gauge theories is similarly computed by large multi-matrix models, that have been considered in the context of ADE minimal models on random surfaces. The associated spectral curves are multiple branched covers obtained as Virasoro and W-constraints of the partition function.",

This gives a method for identifying precise generalisations of the usual matrix models. The framework also leads to a precise and fundamental typology of problems for which the usual approaches are not adequate.

The D detector at Fermilab relies mainly on the energy information obtained usi ng its uranium/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimetry. The experiment has developed a set of corrections, collectively known as the jet energy scale (JES), that translate jet energies measured in the detector to the energies carried by the produced parti cles. This correction is extracted from two-body events, separately for those observed in the detector and for the ones from Monte-Carlo simulation.

They have a strong impact on the surface temperature, which is potentially observable. Here, we reinforce the idea that such magnetic spots can be formed by extracting magnetic energy from the toroidal field that resides in deep crustal layers, via the Hall drift. We study and discuss the magnetothermal evolution of qualitatively different neutron star models and initial magnetic field configurations that lead to the creation of magnetic spots. We find that magnetic spots can be created on a time-scale of 10^4 yr with magnetic field strengths ≳5 × 10^13 G, provided almost the whole magnetic energy is stored in its toroidal component, and that the conductivity in the inner crust is not too large. The lifetime of the magnetic spots is at least ∼one million years, being longer if the initial field permeates both core and crust.",

After the magnetic field reaches a critical level, the core becomes unstable and a magnetic catastrophe occurs, which may be manifested as a magnetic pole and spiral motion of the neutron star. We present a simple dynamical model for a magnetically stable neutron star on the basis of the theory of spin and magnetohydrodynamic equations. The equation of motion for the magnetic field is substituted by the magnetic spin, and the equations of magnetohydrodynamic motion are solved.

The interaction between this radiation and the 'matter' component can provide a fresh explanation for several cosmological puzzles. The 'water' component, for instance, has a high amount of hydrogen, which can form a cosmological constant, whereas other light elements can be easily 'absorbed' by dark matter. In this context, we review the theoretical possibility to explain the observed increase in the cosmic dark energy density by a combination of 'water' (in the form of photons) and 'cosmic dark matter' (in the form of neutrinos).

The LINI pilot beamline is the first facility to operate the dipole at cryogenic temperatures. This in situ commissioning is performed by varying the injection energy, number of pulses, and time of pulse repetition, until the dipole is operated at its design cryogenic temperature. In addition, beam fluence and beam shape are measured to characterize the beam. This work involves correlating the cryostat measurements to the LINI-B beam data in order to understand spatial and temporal effects on the beam characteristics. This allows the cryostat to be tuned to optimize the LINI-B beam condition, which is of particular importance to the ESS. "

    "real_abstract": "We investigate the apparent power-law scaling of the pseudo phase space density (PPSD) in CDM halos. We study fluid collapse, using the close analogy between the gas entropy and the PPSD in the fluid approximation. Our hydrodynamic calculations allow for a precise evaluation of logarithmic derivatives. For scale-free initial conditions, entropy is a power law in Lagrangian (mass) coordinates, but not in Eulerian (radial) coordinates. The deviation from a radial power law arises from incomplete hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), linked to bulk inflow and mass accretion, and the convergence to the asymptotic central power-law slope is very slow. For more realistic collapse, entropy is not a power law with either radius or mass due to deviations from HSE and scale-dependent initial conditions. Instead, it is a slowly rolling power law that appears approximately linear on a log-log plot. Our fluid calculations recover PPSD power-law slopes and residual amplitudes similar to N-body simulations, indicating that deviations from a power law are not numerical artefacts. In addition, we find that realistic collapse is not self-similar: scale lengths such as the shock radius and the turnaround radius are not power-law functions of time. We therefore argue that the apparent power-law PPSD cannot be used to make detailed dynamical inferences or extrapolate halo profiles inward, and that it does not indicate any hidden integrals of motion. We also suggest that the apparent agreement between the PPSD and the asymptotic Bertschinger slope is purely coincidental.",

In particular, implications of recent evidences of heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) by feedback from active galactic nuclei are investigated. Taking also into account the IGM heating associated to structure formation, we argue that values of the y parameter of several × 10(−)(6), i.e. a factor of a few below the COBE/FIRAS upper limit, are to be expected. The Compton scattering by the re-ionized plasma also re-processes primordial distortions, adding a y-type contribution. Hence no pure Bose-Einstein-like distortions are to be expected. An assessment of Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, taking into account the latest results from the Planck satellite as well as the contributions from the strong CII and CO lines from star-forming galaxies, demonstrates that a foreground subtraction accurate enough to fully exploit the PIXIE sensitivity will be extremely challenging. Motivated by this fact we also discuss methods to detect spectral distortions not requiring absolute measurements and show that accurate determinations of the frequency spectrum of the CMB dipole amplitude may substantially improve over COBE/FIRAS limits on distortion parameters. Such improvements may be at reach of next generation CMB anisotropy experiments. The estimated amplitude of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) dipole might be detectable by careful analyses of Planck maps at the highest frequencies. Thus Planck might provide interesting constraints on the CIB intensity, currently known with a simeq 30% uncertainty.",

As part of an ongoing effort to assemble a reliable pipeline for fully automatic data analysis, we put Powell's direction set method to the test. The method does not depend on numerical derivatives, only on function evaluations, and as such it cannot diverge. Compared to differential corrections (DC) and Nelder & Mead's downhill simplex (NMS) method, Powell's method proves to be more efficient in terms of solution determination and the required number of iterations. However, its application is still not optimal in terms of time cost. Causes for this deficiency are identified and two steps toward the solution are proposed: non-ortogonality of the parameter set should be removed and better initial directions should be determined before the minimization is initiated. Once these setbacks are worked out, Powell's method will probably replace DC and NMS as the default minimizing algorithm in PHOEBE modeling package.",

In particular, we explain why it does not have the usual power divergence problem in lattice QCD calculations for the moments of parton distributions. The only power divergence in the LaMET approach comes from the self-energy of the Wilson lines which can be properly factorized. We show that although the Ioffe-time distribution provides an alternative way to extract the parton distribution from the same lattice observables, it also requires the same large momentum (or short distance) limit as in LaMET to obtain a precision calculation. With a proper quantification of errors, both extraction methods shall be compared with the same lattice data.",

According to it the particle is not an object of real world but a superposition of virtual quanta, and the effective theory is a non-perturbative formulation of QFT.

We compare simulations with observations to determine whether the model produces a universe that is known to be baryon-dominated. We find that in the first three decades of the universe according to observational cosmology, the model predicts a baryon-dominated universe, while it is dominated by dark-matter haloes in the fourth decade. In the first decade, the baryon-to-photon ratio is approximately 100, and in the fourth decade it is approximately 1.

    "real_abstract": "In this paper we calculated the spectral dimension of loop quantum gravity (LQG) using the scaling property of the area operator spectrum on spin-network states and using the scaling property of the volume and length operators on Gaussian states. We obtained that the spectral dimension of the spatial section runs from 1.5 to 3, and under particular assumptions from 2 to 3 across a 1.5 phase when the energy of a probe scalar field decreases from high to low energy in a fictitious time T. We calculated also the spectral dimension of space-time using the scaling of the area spectrum operator calculated on spin-foam models. The main result is that the effective dimension is 2 at the Planck scale and 4 at low energy. This result is consistent with two other approaches to non perturbative quantum gravity: 'causal dynamical triangulation' and 'asymptotically safe quantum gravity'. We studied the scaling properties of all the possible curvature invariants and we have shown that the singularity problem seems to be solved in the covariant formulation of quantum gravity in terms of spin-foam models. For a particular form of the scaling (or for a particular area operator spectrum) all the curvature invariants are regular also in the Trans-Planckian regime.",

The annihilation of a massive particle and a subatomic particle produces a positron and an antiproton, a phenomenon which is called annihilation, or annihilation of matter and antimatter (A/M). As a consequence of the correlation between electric charge and volume, a positron with the same electric charge as an electron will have a larger radius than an electron, whereas all antiprotons have the same volume as an electron. The electric charge of the proton is +1 e. In addition, the proton is known to be about 1% smaller in volume than the neutron, which is consistent with the prediction of the vacuum polarization, which reveals the charge of the proton. "

With the recent completion of the Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) survey, we can now gain insight into the high-frequency radio properties of AGN. This paper presents supplementary information on the AT20G sources in the form of optical counterparts and redshifts. Optical counterparts were identified using the SuperCOSMOS database and redshifts were found from either the 6dF Galaxy survey or the literature. We also report 144 new redshifts. For AT20G sources outside the Galactic plane, 78.5% have optical identifications and 30.9% have redshift information. The optical identification rate also increases with increasing flux density. Targets which had optical spectra available were examined to obtain a spectral classification. There appear to be two distinct AT20G populations; the high luminosity quasars that are generally associated with point-source optical counterparts and exhibit strong emission lines in the optical spectrum, and the lower luminosity radio galaxies that are generally associated with passive galaxies in both the optical images and spectroscopic properties. It is suggested that these different populations can be associated with different accretion modes (cold-mode or hot-mode). We find that the cold-mode sources have a steeper spectral index and produce more luminous radio lobes, but generally reside in smaller host galaxies than their hot-mode counterparts. This can be attributed to the fact that they are accreting material more efficiently. Lastly, we compare the AT20G survey with the S-cubed semi-empirical (S3-SEX) models and conclude that the S3-SEX models need refining to correctly model the compact cores of AGN. The AT20G survey provides the ideal sample to do this.",

Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) may scatter efficiently in the core or in the crust of a neutron star. In this paper we focus on WIMP contributions to transport properties, such as shear viscosity or thermal conductivity, because these can be greatly enhanced by long mean free paths. We speculate that WIMPs increase the shear viscosity of neutron star matter and help stabilize r-mode oscillations. These are collective oscillations where the restoring force is the Coriolis force. At present r-modes are thought to be unstable in many observed rapidly rotating stars. If WIMPs stabilize the r-modes, this would allow neutron stars to spin rapidly. This likely requires WIMP-nucleon cross sections near present experimental limits and an appropriate density of WIMPs in neutron stars.",

The examination of the transonic properties of such flows can be useful in self-consistently discriminating between prograde and retrograde relativistic accretion, and in studying the spectral signatures of black hole rotation.",

We estimate the mass of the accreted material and the time for a full accretion. The mass of the accreted material is proportional to the spin M/S. Thus, the mass of the accreted material scales as M/S. In the limit M/S scales as the Schwarzschild radius, we find the amount of material accreted scales as M/S. This scaling is independent of the mass of the black hole or the spin parameter, indicating that all black holes, regardless of mass and spin, can accrete. The time for a full accretion T scales as the square root of M/S, and any dependence on the mass of the black hole is of the order of the full accretion time scaling. "

Our simulations were performed on 163×8 lattices with a quark mass mq=0.0125, in units of the inverse lattice spacing. By monitoring the Wilson-Polyakov line, the chiral order parameter 〈ψ¯ψ〉, and the average plaquette, we have determined that a crossover between the low-temperature state of ordinary hadronic matter and the high-temperature quark-gluon plasma occurs at a gauge coupling of 6g2=5.54(2). Thermodynamic quantities do not show a large jump, although the equilibration time becomes quite long in the vicinity of the crossover. We have measured the entropy densities in the neighborhood of the crossover and further into the plasma phase. Measurements of the hadronic screening lengths and the Debye screening lengths were made which cast light on the differences between the two regimes.

    "title": "Spin-orbit evolution of short-period planets.",
    "real_abstract": "The negligible eccentricity of all extra solar planets with periods less than six days can be accounted for by dissipation of tidal disturbances within their envelopes which are induced by their host stars. In the period range of 7-21 days, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits. These will be referred to as the borderline planets. We propose that this discrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of young stars. In particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidal disturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star can excite eccentricity growth, and for a more slowly spinning star, at least reduce the eccentricity damping rate. In contrast, tidal dissipation within the envelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricity damping process. Based on these results, we suggest that short-period planets around relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricity than those around mature stars. We also suggest that because the rate of angular momentum loss from G and K dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster than the tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very-short (3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration in which the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel and synchronous with the orbital frequency. In principle, however, such configurations may be established for planets (around G and K dwarfs) with orbital periods of up to several weeks. In contrast to G and K dwarfs, the angular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in F dwarfs. It is therefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around such stars. The planet around Tau Boo is one such example.",

But in the presence of significant dynamical non-radial motion (as in the case of short-period planets), it is possible for the energy of the spin-orbit resonance to decay slowly, leading to a significant dynamical evolution of the planet. If a planet has a short period and a resonant orbit with a large spin-orbit energy, then the spin-orbit energy decays rapidly, and over a time interval comparable to the mean planet semimajor axis, the planet sweeps out a large region in the resonance. In this paper, we show that the dynamical evolution of the planet is a significant contribution to its observed orbital elements. "

The accreting objects at the galaxy centers are expected to be intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with M_BH < 1e6 M_sun. The AGNs were selected using several optical emission-line diagnostics after careful modeling of the continuum present in the spectra. We have limited our survey to objects with spectral characteristics similar to those of Seyfert nuclei, excluding emission-line galaxies with ambiguous spectra that could be powered by stellar processes. The host galaxies in our sample are thus the least massive objects in the very local universe certain to contain central black holes. Given our focus on the nearest objects included in the SDSS, our survey is more sensitive to low-luminosity emission than previous optical searches for AGNs in low-mass galaxies. The [O III] lambda5007 luminosities of the Seyfert nuclei in our sample have a median value of L_5007 = 2e5 L_sun and extend down to 1e4 L_sun. Using published data for broad-line IMBH candidates, we have derived an [O III] bolometric correction of log (L_bol/L_5007) = 3.0 +/- 0.3, which is significantly lower than values obtained for high-luminosity AGNs. Applying this correction to our sample, we obtain minimum black-hole mass estimates that fall mainly in the 10^3 M_sun -- 10^4 M_sun range, which is roughly where the predicted mass functions for different black-hole seed formation scenarios overlap the most. In the stellar mass range that includes the bulk of the AGN host galaxies in our sample, we derive a lower limit on the AGN fraction of a few percent, indicating that active nuclei in dwarf galaxies are not as rare as previously thought.",
    "fake_abstract": " We model the AGN activity of nearby dwarf galaxies with the presence of a supermassive black hole in the galactic core. We find that the presence of a galactic-core black hole reduces the AGN luminosity of a typical bright, nearby dwarf galaxy by at least a factor of two, but may even reduce the luminosity by a factor of four or more. This effect can be easily reproducible with the models and observations presented in this work, as well as with current data sets. As a result of this reduction, the galactic accretion rate is smaller, and the virial equation is obeyed only approximately. We find that the region of the virial surface lying inside the orbit of the central black hole, and that is located at least 10 kpc (the virial radius) from the black hole, is populated with low-mass stars, which are analogous to the in-orbit binaries observed in the remote galaxies. The stars in this region are gradually destroyed, and thus the number of stars in this region decreases with time. We find that the central black hole probably forms the majority of the stars in the bright galaxy, although the formation of a galactic-core black hole affects the mass distribution in different ways in different galaxies. We also find that the spins of the stars in the central region are definitely correlated with the mass of the central black hole, although the black hole mass may be greater than the free-fall time of the stars. In some galaxies, in which the central black hole is a small fraction of the total galaxy mass, the spins of the stars are correlated with the mass of the central black hole. The correlation between the spins and the mass may be interpreted as the runaway effect of the formation of the black hole. In other galaxies, in which the black hole is a large fraction of the total galaxy mass, the spins of the stars are anticorrelated with the mass of the central black hole."

It is also shown that this time-like and energyless signaling in massless fields occurs in Dirichlet cavities, which shows that the phenomenon is not confined to setups with a zero mode. Moreover, it is shown that the phenomenon extends beyond perturbation theory, namely by deriving the phenomenon non-perturbatively for the case where the sender and receiver systems are modeled as harmonic oscillators.

We model the mass-velocity and fundamental plane relations of these galaxies, which are constructed from the galaxy stellar mass, disk scale length, and optical Halpha rotation velocity at 2.2 scale lengths. We calculate a sequence of model galaxy populations, defined by the distribution of the stellar disk-to-total mass fraction, m_d. We include the effect of adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos in response to condensation of baryons. We find that models with constant m_d underpredict the intrinsic scatter of the TF and FP relations and predict an (unobserved) strong correlation between TF residuals. Introducing a scatter of disk mass fractions and allowing the mean value m_d to scale with the stellar surface density significantly improves observational match of both the slope and intercept of the TF relation and reduces the predicted residual correlation enough to be consistent with the data. Our best-fit models with a Kroupa stellar IMF over-produce the galaxy stellar mass function and predict the virial r-band mass-to-light ratios, M_vir/L_r, systematically lower than those inferred from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and satellite dynamics. We investigate three possible solutions to these problems: (1) ignoring the effects of adiabatic contraction, (2) adopting a ``light'' stellar IMF, or (3) considering the lower halo concentrations predicted for a low cosmological power spectrum normalization. Any of these solutions yields acceptable residual correlations and relieves most of the observational tension between the TF relation and the galaxy stellar mass function (abridged).",

It would therefore be possible to determine the inclination of the innermost planet CoRoT-7b with respect to the observer after an observation of at least three years from space with the satellite CoRoT with sufficient precision. Different inclinations would cause different duration of the transit times of a planet in front of the star and would therefore give us a better knowledge of the architecture of this system.With the aid of numerical integrations and analytical estimations we checked how inclined orbits of additional planets would change the transit duration of CoRoT-7b.

This expression is the sum of parts of the above plane surface areas of the other two planets, from where the inclination of the plane of nodes of the planet i can be calculated.

Furthermore, the asymmetry is observed to have the opposite sign in power spectra made from line-of-sight velocity and continuum intensity. The asymmetry and its reversal in sign has previously been explained using a combination of mechanisms that involve the acoustic source. A localized acoustic source within an acoustic cavity naturally generates asymmetric profiles through wave interference/ however, the sign of the asymmetry due to this mechanism is identical for all observables. The reversal of the asymmetry between velocity and intensity observations has been attributed to the visibility of the source itself (i.e., 'correlated noise'). In this paper, I will show that asymmetry generated by a localized source can be interpreted as either a wave interference effect in physical space, or a mode interference effect in spectral space. I advocate a new mode-fitting procedure based on this new interpretation, whereby the complex phases of all the modes determine the mode asymmetries. Further, I suggest that information about the acoustic source function is encapsulated in the amplitude of each mode, and present a scheme by which the source function can be obtained from measured mode amplitudes by standard helioseismic inversion techniques.",

Multiple slices may be removed successively and a process for locally flattening the distribution to obtain equal batch intensities is used. When successive batches are unstacked and ejected, the process may have to be aborted if the particles do not arrive correctly at the user.

The signal is correlated with the number of pions produced to extract from it the fraction of the antiproton annihilations that occurred in the target. The number of signal units produced is proportional to the number of annihilations in the target and is independent of the energy of the annihilations.

We solve the modified gravity equations with new modified gravity metric keeping the same structure of the classical Einstein equations. The source term of the Einstein field equations is modified to include the cosmic shear. The geometry of the modified gravity metric is defined as the bimetric space-times which contain the same space-time more than once. We study the modified gravity theory with cosmic shear in the standard flat spacetime models. We confirm the physically consistent modified gravity theory with cosmic shear. We give an example about the modified gravity theory with cosmic shear for the massive $S$-atmosphere in the Schwarzschild-like geometry. "

    "real_abstract": "We present the Dynamic Eclipse Mapping (DEM) method designed specifically to reconstruct the surface intensity patterns of non-radial stellar oscillations in eclipsing binaries. The method needs a geometric model of the binary, accepts the light curve and the detected pulsation frequencies on input, and on output yields estimates of the pulsation patterns, in form of images -- thus allowing a direct identification of the surface mode numbers$(\\ell,m)$. Since it has minimal modelling requirements and can operate on photometric observations in arbitrary wavelength bands, DEM is well suited to analyze the wide-band time series collected by space observatories. The method was extensively tested on simulated data, in which almost all photometrically detectable modes with a latitudinal complexity $\\ell-|m|\\le 4$ were properly restored. Multimode pulsations can be also reconstructed in a natural manner, as well as pulsations on components with tilted rotation axis of known direction. It can also be used in principle to isolate the contribution of hidden modes from the light curve. Sensitivity tests show that moderate errors in the geometric parameters and the assumed limb darkening can be partially tolerated by the inversion, in the sense that the lower degree modes are still recoverable. Tidally induced or mutually resonant pulsations, however, are an obstacle that neither the eclipse mapping, nor any other inversion technique can ever surpass. We conclude that, with reasonable assumptions, Dynamic Eclipse Mapping could be a powerful tool for mode identification, especially in moderately close eclipsing binary systems, where the pulsating component is not seriously affected by tidal interactions so that the pulsations are intrinsic to them, and not a consequence of the binarity.",
    "fake_abstract": " A photometric mode identification (PMI) method is applied to the data of eclipsing binary systems. The method is based on a generalization of the method of photometric mode identification of eclipsing binaries by Markevitch & Wilkes (1974). The basic idea is to construct a model for the distribution of lightcurve chronologies and to identify the modes which are present in the lightcurves with all the phases of the binary orbital motion. For the P=2 system 9 Geminids we have studied the identification procedure using this PMI method. As a result, nine new lightcurves have been determined. The orbital elements are derived from the lightcurve data. The new lightcurves are compared with predictions of the orbital models of Markevitch & Wilkes, Markevitch & Oke, Markevitch & Zharikov, Markevitch & Wilkes, Markevitch & Tabatabaei, Markevitch & Aliev, Markevitch & Aliev, and Markevitch & Gorbovskii. In all cases, the identification process has produced the expected result and we have determined the orbital elements with reasonable accuracy. The method is applied to the P=0 and P=1 systems HD 40307 and HD 40307A and the results confirm the previous results of Markevitch & Wilkes. The difference between lightcurve predictions and derived orbital elements for P=1 systems is explained by their higher inclination.

Much of the earlier work concerning quantum black holes has been in the limit of large charges when the area of the even horizon is also large. In recent years there has been substantial progress in understanding the entropy of supersymmetric black holes within string theory going well beyond the large charge limit. It has now become possible to begin exploring finite size effects in perturbation theory in inverse size and even nonperturbatively, with highly nontrivial agreements between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Unlike the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy which follows from the two-derivative Einstein-Hilbert action, these finite size corrections depend sensitively on the phase under consideration and contain a wealth of information about the details of compactification as well as the spectrum of nonperturbative states in the theory. Finite-size corrections are therefore very interesting as a valuable window into the microscopic degrees of freedom of the quantum theory.",

This solution is not relativistically invariant, in contrast to the relativistically invariant black hole solutions with charge K=1.

The quantum black hole will be a quantum phase space polynomial solution of the field equations. It may be compactified in a three-dimensional quantum phase space with a Coulomb-like charge. In the presence of an external source of gravitational field its quantum density is a function of its radius only, and its quantum horizon is a constant.

Faint galaxies in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF) and the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) are compared with our model galaxies. We have determined the astrophysical parameters in the SAM that reproduce observations of nearby galaxies, and used them to predict the number counts and redshifts of faint galaxies for three cosmological models, the standard cold dark matter (CDM) universe, a flat lambda-CDM, and an open CDM. The novelty of our SAM analysis is the inclusion of selection effects arising from the cosmological dimming of surface brightness of high-z galaxies, and from the absorption of visible light by internal dust and intergalactic HI clouds. As was found in our previous work, in which the UV/optical HDF galaxies were compared with our model galaxies, we find that our SAM reproduces counts of near-IR SDF galaxies in low-density models, and that the standard CDM universe is not preferred, as suggested by other recent studies. Moreover, we find that simple prescriptions for (1) the timescale of star formation being proportional to the dynamical time scale of the formation of galactic disks, (2) the size of galactic disks being rotationally supported with the same specific angular momentum as that of surrounding dark halo, and (3) the dust optical depth being proportional to the metallicity of cold gas, cannot completely explain all of observed data.

The largest increase in population number counts is found for the MgII epoch, when the peak luminosity of the galaxy formation event is reached. The numerical simulations also confirm that the increase in population number counts is not driven by the increase in the number of merging clusters due to the higher baryon density and the significant fraction of the merging fragments which end up in the outskirts of the merging cluster. Finally, we show that increasing the galaxy formation efficiency of the Milky Way-like model by 3% leads to an increase of the number counts of the local Universe by 12% over the predictions by the standard cold dark matter cosmological model."

In addition, we present an optical spectrum from Keck LRIS from which we measure the redshift of the burst, z=0.6528. At this redshift the isotropic-equivalent prompt energy release was about 10^51 erg, and using a standard afterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy is a factor of 10 larger, E_K,iso ~ 10^52 erg. The lack of an observed jet break to t ~ 20 days indicates that the opening angle is larger than 7 deg and the total beaming-corrected relativistic energy is larger than 10^50 erg. We further show that the burst produced a strong radio flare at t ~ 40 days accompanied by an observed flattening in the X-ray band which we attribute to an abrupt circumburst density jump or an episode of energy injection (either from a refreshed shock or off-axis ejecta). Late-time observations with HST show evidence for an associated supernova with peak optical luminosity roughly comparable to that of SN 1998bw. Next, we show that the host galaxy of XRF 050416a is actively forming stars at a rate of at least 2 M_solar per year with a luminosity of L_B ~ 0.5L* and metallicity of Z ~ 0.2-0.8 Z_solar.

The radio flare occurred in July and August of 2004, in the FRB 031a source region, which has been identified as the progenitor of the XRF 050416a source. We show that the spectrum of this radio flare is remarkably similar to that of the XRF 050416a source, and hence strongly suggests that this source may be the same as that of the radio flare. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radio flare is found to be similar to the one of XRF 050416a, but the radio flux is less than 10% of the one of XRF 050416a.

Probing the redshift range z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an X-ray detected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation derived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. At z=1, we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two less than in passive centrals at the same halo mass. This implies that the presence or lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochastic process. By z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the different growth rates of these objects. A similar but weaker trend is observed when dividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. Remarkably, we find that star-forming centrals at z~1 live in groups that are significantly more clustered on 10 Mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passive centrals. We discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recent simulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higher angular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halos are known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. If confirmed, this would be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history of halos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that form inside them.",

However, the formation histories of massive galaxies and their halos, and their correlations, have not been studied within a global cosmological context.

In particular, the correlations between galactic formation rates and mass-to-light ratio and the mass-to-light ratio and galactic formation times can be understood if the formation rate of massive galaxies is correlated with the formation rate of dark matter halos, which is dependent on the formation history of the halo. We also discuss the possibility that the correlation between formation rates and mass-to-light ratio might be due to the correlation between galaxy formation times with the formation history of the halo.

The instability is important for transporting and mixing heat, as well as for influencing large-scale variability on the planets. Both linear normal mode analysis and non-linear initial value calculations are carried out -- focusing on the freely-evolving, adiabatic situation. Using a high-resolution general circulation model (GCM) which solves the traditional primitive equations, we show that large-scale jets similar to those observed in current GCM simulations of hot extrasolar giant planets are likely to be baroclinically unstable on a timescale of few to few tens of planetary rotations, generating cyclones and anticyclones that drive weather systems. The growth rate and scale of the most unstable mode obtained in the linear analysis are in qualitative, good agreement with the full non-linear calculations. In general, unstable jets evolve differently depending on their signs (eastward or westward), due to the change in sign of the jet curvature. For jets located at or near the equator, instability is strong at the flanks -- but not at the core. Crucially, the instability is either poorly or not at all captured in simulations with low resolution and/or high artificial viscosity. Hence, the instability has not been observed or emphasized in past circulation studies of hot extrasolar planets.",

In the framework of spherical accretion onto a rapidly rotating, roughly steady, magnetic sphere, we derive the mass-loss rate of a stellar object with a given surface rotational velocity and magnetic field, and the expected characteristic time for fragmentation to occur due to the magneto-gyro-rotational instability. These mass-loss rate and fragmentation times scales are used to model the mass-loss history and the resulting stellar mass function for a sample of stars observed in the solar neighborhood. The mixture of stars with low, intermediate and high mass-loss rates and corresponding mass-fragmentation times largely affects the resulting stellar IMF, while the characteristic time scales do not. The presence of the magnetic field in the donor star, which can be assumed to be the result of a dynamically stable configuration, has little effect on the mass-loss and fragmentation time scales, and the resulting stellar mass function. The characteristic time scales are generally smaller than those given by the global fragmentation criterion, which leads to the conclusion that the disk accretion scenario is unlikely to be the origin of the disk formed for high mass stars.

We show that the combined light flash timing of several millisecond pulsars can be used to determine the binary mass and hence the mass of the black hole, provided the pulsars have orbital periods longer than 10^(-3) ms. We also show how timing observations can be used in combination with X-ray studies of nearby massive black hole binaries to determine the mass-transfer rates of the accreting object. This can be used to measure the spin-down torque and hence the mass of the accreting object, which is a crucial parameter for the calculation of the binary mass. "

    "title": "Theories of the ABC Effect.",
    "real_abstract": "The ABC effect is an enhancement which appears at around 310 MeV in the missing-mass spectra of the inclusive reactions: pn → d , pd → 3 He , and dd → 4 He . For a long time it was regarded as evidence for a low-mass I = 0, J P = 0 + ππ resonance. But such states have never been seen in ordinary hadronic processes, like π N → N ππ . Most of the evidence now points to 3-3 resonance excitation in nuclei as the root cause of the effect. In this paper a number of possible mechanisms are examined. We find, on the basis of explicit calculations which neglect only the spins of the particles, that the one-pion-exchange model of Risser and Shuster provides a qualitative description of some of the data. The model of Anjos, Levy and Santoro is not substantiated by independent calculation, while the Brody model has little predictive power. A critical review of the various models is presented.",
    "fake_abstract": " The recent observation, by the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration, that the photon number of a nucleus, N, is normally greater than the number of high-state photons, Q, was taken as an evidence that the quark Effective Weak Strong Interaction, the so-called QED-contribution, is not given by Q^n[Q^2-Q]^2, where Q^n=Q-K^n, where K^n is the K-vector. When Q^n<Q, the QED-contribution is determined by the conventional QED-theory. Here we suggest a theoretical interpretation for this anomaly. We imagine that K is not an effective QED-strength in the $W^{-\\Sigma}$ channel, and that K^n is the relevant quantity. When K^n<Q, the measured N has a topological Yang-Mills structure, like N=(N+N, K^n)^3. When K^n=Q, the N=N+N is shown to be a pure Chern insulator."

Different diagnostics such as index-index, gradient-gradient diagrams, and simple stellar population models are used to tackle the origin of the variation of the bulge stellar population. We find that the vast majority of bulges show older age, lower metallicity and higher [alpha/Fe] in their outer regions than in their central parts. The radial gradients in [Fe/H] are 2 to 3 times larger than in Log(age). The relation between gradient and bulge velocity dispersion is interpreted as a gradual build up of the gradient mean values and their dispersions from high to low velocity dispersion, rather than a pure correlation. The bulge effective radii and the Hubble type of the parent galaxies seem to play a more minor role in causing the observed spatial distributions. At a given velocity dispersion, bulges and ellipticals share common properties.",

We focus on the relation between bulge age and virial mass, and we find that the slope of this relation increases with the Hubble type of the bulge galaxies. We interpret this behaviour as an indication that the formation properties of the bulge population are changing with the Hubble type. We have calibrated the relation to a sample of galaxies in the Laniakea supercluster and find that it is similar for the bulge populations in the Virgo and Fornax clusters, but that it decreases with increasing Hubble type. We compare the relation with the correlation between virial mass and the rotation velocity of the bulge and we find a good correspondence for the Virgo and Fornax clusters but that the correlation is clearly weak for the type II and III bulges in the Laniakea supercluster. We speculate that the unphysical behaviour of the population gradient at late types is related to the presence of inner 100 kpc scales of lower mass galaxies in the bulge. "

It is also a powerful source of such radiation, covering an exceptionally broad frequency range from about 200 GHz to 100 THz. At the soft x-ray free-electron laser FLASH we have installed a beam transport channel for transition radiation (TR) with the intention to guide a large fraction of the radiation to a laboratory outside the accelerator tunnel. The radiation is produced on a screen inside the ultrahigh vacuum beam pipe of the linac, coupled out through a diamond window and transported to the laboratory through an evacuated tube equipped with five focusing and four plane mirrors. The design of the beamline has been based on a thorough analysis of the generation of TR on metallic screens of limited size. The optical propagation of the radiation has been computed taking into account the effects of near-field (Fresnel) diffraction. The theoretical description of the TR source is presented in the first part of the paper, while the design principles and the technical layout of the beamline are described in the second part.

The hadron spectra calculated with both sets of hadronization functions agree well, which indicates that our method for calculating the hadronization function works successfully.

We find that the contribution of the quark mass to the fragmentation function is dominant only from the first collision to UHECRs. We calculate the giant dipole divergences of the UHECRs to estimate distributions of quark masses at the first UHECRs and find that the charged particle spectrum is approximately flat. We also compare the fragmentation function with the known E_t and πη cross sections as a function of the cut-off mass m_c, to determine the role of the quark mass m_quark in the production of UHECRs. We find that a quark mass of around 100 GeV contributes to the production of UHECRs when a typical E_t mass of 50 GeV is around the cut-off mass of UHECRs, but has no role for lower E_t masses. "

    "real_abstract": "We predict the fraction of dark halo lenses, that is, the fraction of lens systems produced by the gravitational potential of dark halos, on the basis of a simple parametric model of baryonic compression. The fraction of dark halo lenses primarily contains information on the effect of baryonic compression and the density profile of dark halos, and is expected to be insensitive to cosmological parameters and source population. The model we adopt comprises the galaxy formation probability p_g(M) which describes the global efficiency of baryonic compression and the ratio of circular velocities of galaxies to virial velocities of dark halos gamma_v=v_c/v_{vir} which means how the inner structure of dark halos is modified due to baryonic compression. The model parameters are constrained from the velocity function of galaxies and the distribution of image separations in gravitational lensing, although the degeneracy between model parameters still remains. We show that the fraction of dark halo lenses depends strongly on gamma_v and the density profile of dark halos such as inner slope alpha. This means that the observation of the fraction of dark halos can break the degeneracy between model parameters if the density profile of dark halo lenses is fully settled. On the other hand, by restricting gamma_v to physically plausible range we can predict the lower limit of the fraction of dark halo lenses on the basis of our model. Our result indicates that steeper inner cusps of dark halos (alpha >~ 1.5) or too centrally concentrated dark halos are inconsistent with the lack of dark halo lenses in observations.",

However, the presence of a large bulge is only directly detectable from the stellar populations inside the bulge and cannot be directly inferred from the distribution of dark halos. We have derived constraints on the baryonic mass distribution in the Milky Way halos. By using the colour–magnitude diagrams of stars in the inner Milky Way, we find that dark halos are likely to form inside the halo if the baryonic mass density in this halo exceeds the critical value {defined as the density at which dark halos begin to form} by a factor of 5. Using these constraints on the mass distribution of the Milky Way halos, we then infer the mass density of the dark halos in the Milky Way. We find that the mass density is higher than the critical value by a factor of 5 at a radius of $R_{\\mathrm{dark}} \\sim 1 \\mbox{ kpc}$. Using this mass density for the population of dark halos in the Milky Way and considering the fact that the mass of the bulge is a few times larger than the expected mass of the dark halos in the halo, we derive constraints on the mass of the bulge. Given the mass budget of the bulge, we find that the total mass of the halo is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the total mass of the bulge. We also find that the mass of the halo is below the critical value by a factor of 4. This implies that the amount of dark halos in the Milky Way is likely to be less than a factor of 5 the size of the bulge."

The high quality hard X-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of the Compton reflection component for the first time in these sources. Using quasi-simultaneous NuSTAR and Swift/XRT data, as well as archival XMM-Newton data, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by Compton-thick material with column densities in excess of ~5 × 10(24) cm(–)(2), and that their X-ray spectra above 3 keV are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum on Compton-thick material. Due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsic continuum components are not formally required by the data in any of the sources. We constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density of the reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. Using archival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic X-ray luminosities consistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. Our results are consistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with a relatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency of the order of 1%.

The metal diffusion leads the models to have much higher temperature in the radiation interior, correspondingly the higher sound speed in the interior of the model, thereby the larger frequency and spacings.",

If the medium is free of emission, the detector does not measure any emission level. If the medium is partially emitting (consistently or stochastically), then the emission level recorded by the detector depends on the emission level in the medium. This effect is used to model a variety of astrophysical sources and detectors. In this paper we consider two astrophysical sources: a black hole and the recently discovered dwarf planet, $\\epsilon$ Eridani. The black hole emits thermal radiation via a disk accretion process and its disk is partially emitting. We use the local radiative transfer equation to model the black hole, and we evaluate its observed level to test the element diffusion prediction. For the dwarf planet we use a more realistic model, including a binary system and element diffusion. We have tested our model by comparing synthetic and observed data on the black hole (HD 140283), and by comparing synthetic and observed data on $\\epsilon$ Eridani. Our results on the black hole show that the element diffusion model accurately reproduces the observed level, while the models without element diffusion do not reproduce the observed level. This effect is expected because the element diffusion model is more sensitive to the amount of element emission in the disk. Our results suggest that the element diffusion model is indeed a useful tool for interpreting observations of the element diffusion of $\\epsilon$ Eridani.

We also examine the spectrum of scalar perturbations of the metric that are created by the inflaton fluctuations that have left the Hubble sphere during inflation and the spectrum of density perturbations that they produce at reentry after inflation has ended. When the inflaton dispersion spectrum is renormalized during the expansion, we show (for the case of the quadratic inflaton potential) that the density perturbation spectrum approaches a mass-independent limit as the inflaton mass approaches zero, and remains near that limiting value for masses less than about 1/4 of the inflationary Hubble constant. We show that this limiting behavior does not occur if one only makes the Minkowski space subtraction, without the further adiabatic subtractions that involve time derivatives of the expansion scale factor $a(t)$. We also find a parametrized expression for the energy density produced by the change in $a(t)$ as inflation ends. If the end of inflation were sufficiently abrupt, then the temperature corresponding to this energy density could be very significant. We also show that fluctuations of the inflaton field that are present before inflation starts are not dissipated during inflation, and could have a significant observational effect today.

Our model is applicable in the case in which the thermalization time from SN is sufficiently long that spatial variations are relatively unimportant, an appropriate assumption for the empirical parameters adopted here. The departure from a standard scenario of passive evolution implies significantly younger luminosity-weighted ages for the stellar populations of low-mass galaxies at moderate redshifts, even though the more physically meaningful mass-weighted ages are changed only slightly. Secondary bursts of star formation also lead to a natural explanation of the large scatter in the NUV-optical relation observed in clusters at moderate redshift and account for the population of E+A galaxies that display a spheroidal morphology. As the late-time formation of stars in our model is due to the gradual cooling of the interstellar medium, which is heated to temperatures ~1 keV by the initial burst of supernovae, our conclusions do not rely on any environmental effects or external mechanisms. Furthermore, a simple estimate of the X-ray emission from this supernova heated gas leads to an L_X vs L_B correlation that is in good agreement with observed values. Thus feedback processes may be essential to understanding the observed properties of early-type galaxies from the optical to the X-ray.",

The structure of ETGs is analyzed in the frame of a hierarchical model in which they undergo evolutionary shifts in composition and in size and shape during their evolution. The feedback processes, in the form of energy-conversion processes and winds, are examined with the help of a modified radiative-transfer calculations. It is shown that the feedback process, in the form of winds, becomes relevant for ETGs less massive than MeV-age stars. "

Second, we observe a significant suppression of B s → Shg in the range /2-0.5, which translates to a significant reduction in the B s → Rg amplitude. This indicates that hadronic decays affect B → Rg enough to dominate its production in the same region of integrated luminosity, contrary to the commonly accepted notion that hadronic contributions to B decays into higher-L resonances are negligible. Our results are discussed in the context of the recent measurements at the LHC."

Subsequently, the foils were counted for the induced ground state activity of 180Ta. From the thick target yields an IS between 0.6 and 2.2 MeV excitation energy was inferred. The population of the IS in the stellar environment of the s process depends critically on the prevailing temperatures. Current stellar models suggest s-process temperatures below 3.1×108 K which lead to a negligible population of intermediate states above 1.2 MeV.

Although our applications have focused on Galactic supernova remnants, the software is modular, making it straightforward to customize for different applications. In particular, the shapes of the particle distribution functions and the shape of the seed photon spectrum used by the inverse Compton model are defined in separate modules and may be customized for specific applications. We assess the accuracy of these models by using a recurrence relation and by comparing them with analytic results and with previous numerical work by other authors.",

The proper time-dependent momentum-dependent momentum-independent charge-independent and charge-dependent operator coefficients of a photon propagator model and the energy dependence of these operator coefficients are also derived. We find that the energy dependence of the proper time-dependent momentum-independent and momentum-independent operator coefficients of a photon propagator model is a direct consequence of the photon mass.

We measure the VPF as a function of galaxy color and luminosity in both surveys and find that it mimics trends displayed in the two-point correlation function, $\\xi$: namely that samples of brighter, red galaxies have larger voids (i.e. are more strongly clustered) than fainter, blue galaxies. We also clearly detect evolution in the VPF with cosmic time, with voids being larger in comoving units at z~0. We find that the reduced VPF matches the predictions of a `negative binomial' model for galaxies of all colors, luminosities, and redshifts studied. This model lacks a physical motivation, but produces a simple analytic prediction for sources of any number density and integrated two-point correlation function, \\bar{\\xi}. This implies that differences in the VPF across different galaxy populations are consistent with being due entirely to differences in the population number density and \\bar{\\xi}. The robust result that all galaxy populations follow the negative binomial model appears to be due to primarily to the clustering of dark matter halos. The reduced VPF is insensitive to changes in the parameters of the halo occupation distribution, in the sense that halo models with the same \\bar{\\xi} will produce the same VPF. For the wide range of galaxies studied, the VPF therefore does not appear to provide useful constraints on galaxy evolution models that cannot be gleaned from studies of \\bar{\\xi} alone.

We obtain a void fraction of z~0.28±0.03 by using observed radio luminosity (âˆ¼67 per cent) and by modelling the baryonic mass budget of galaxies (âˆ¼33 per cent). Using only galaxy observations, we obtain a void fraction of z~0.30.

It is based on the recoil of a K nucleus from the target nucleus in the equation: K+ =K0 + pH, where H is the hypernucleus and p is the recoil energy. The hypernucleus is formed by a cascade of nuclear cascades; the first cascade consists of two elastic interactions between clouds of K nuclei in the target and produced nuclei of the target (K0 and K1), while in the second cascade, the recoil of the hypernucleus is produced by a deformation of the target nucleus (K2). The theory can be applied to the formation of simple nuclides, in which there is no Coulomb repulsion between the target nucleus and π-cloud. The theory predicts the formation of hypernatuclei having the target nucleus, which is a very important feature of real nuclides. As an example of its application, the formation of Zn and Nd is discussed, where the hypernucleus has the same mass as a nuclide formed from the reaction of K capture with He, the target. "

In particular, we focus on the interstellar medium of the proposed, locally flat universe. We show that the sources of gravitational radiation, mainly radiating in the cold sector, are two orders of magnitude smaller than the dominant sources of mass and energy, the nonrotating and nonaccelerating components of dark energy, and dark matter. The contribution of the gravitational radiation to the baryons number at large redshift is set to be less than one percent, which is coincident with the prediction of the standard cosmological model. This dominance of dark energy and dark matter over the gravitational radiation sources arises because they account for nearly all the sources of gravitational energy at all scales.

The latter effect is responsible for making the Higgs discovery difficult. We show that the contribution to the sensitivity from large extra dimensions is partly cancelled by the contribution from supersymmetry. We also show how the measurement of the Z_boson spin observables for the charge asymmetry $\\chi$ and the transverse mass as a function of the lighter top quark mass is more sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model. We consider two scenarios for the Z_boson mass. In the Standard Model scenario, the supersymmetry breaking is such that the lightest top quark has a mass in the region $M_t \\leq 4$ GeV. In the Superheavy Quintet scenario, the lightest top quark has a mass on the order of $M_t \\leq 10$ GeV. In this scenario, the lightest top quark mass $M_t$ is only weakly sensitive to the spin perturbation in the gaugino mass region $M_{t\\pm} > 8$ GeV. The sensitivity of the $\\chi$ mass to new physics can be dramatically increased by supersymmetry breaking.

The method relies on defining the coboundary operator of the local Weyl group, and giving a cohomological interpretation to counterterms in the effective action in dimensional regularization with respect to this group. Non-trivial cocycles of the Weyl group arise from local functionals that are Weyl invariant in and only in the physical even integer dimension. In the physical dimension the non-trivial cocycles generate covariant non-local action functionals characterized by sensitivity to global Weyl rescalings. The non-local action so obtained is unique up to the addition of trivial cocycles and Weyl invariant terms, both of which are insensitive to global Weyl rescalings. These distinct behaviors under rigid dilations can be used to distinguish between infrared relevant and irrelevant operators in a generally covariant manner. Variation of the $d=4$ non-local effective action yields two new conserved geometric stress tensors with local traces. The method may be extended to any even dimension by making use of the general construction of conformal invariants given by Fefferman and Graham. As a corollary, conformal field theory behavior of correlators at the asymptotic infinity of either anti-de Sitter or de Sitter spacetimes follows, i.e. AdS$_{d+1}$ or deS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ correspondence. The same construction naturally selects all infrared relevant terms (and only those terms) in the low energy effective action of gravity in any even integer dimension. The infrared relevant terms arising from the known anomalies in d=4 imply that the classical Einstein theory is modified at large distances.",

The calculated results show that the nucleon emission number $N_{n}$ depends sensitively the isospin effect of nucleon nucleon cross section and weakly on the isospin dependent mean field for neutron-poor system in higher beam energy region . In particular, the correlation between the medium correction of two-body collision and the momentum dependent interaction enhances the dependence of nucleon emission number $N_{n}$ on the isospin effect of nucleon nucleon cross section. On the contrary, the ratio of the neutron proton ratio of the gas phase to the neutron proton ratio of the liquid phase, i.e., the degree of isospin fractionation $<(N/Z)_{gas}>_{b}/<(N/Z)_{liq}>_{b}$ depends sensitively on the isospin dependent mean field and weakly on the isospin effect of two-body collision for neutron-rich system in the lower beam energy region.

We find a factor of 2.6 excess of warm H2/PAH in our sample relative to the observed fractions in other nearby galaxies.

Starting with short-period binary models of \\leq5Msun He-rich stars (18-25Msun on the main-sequence), we produce 1.2B ejecta which we artificially mix to alter the chemical stratification. While the total 56Ni mass influences the LC peak, the spatial distribution of 56Ni, controlled by mixing processes, impacts both the multi-band LCs and spectra. With enhanced mixing, our synthetic LCs start their post-breakout re-brightening phase earlier, follow a more gradual rise to peak, appear redder, and fade faster after peak due to enhanced gamma-ray escape. Non-thermal electrons, crucial for the production of HeI lines, deposit a dominant fraction of their energy as heat. Because energy deposition is generally local well after the LC peak, the broad HeI lines characteristic of maximum-light SN IIb/Ib spectra require mixing that places 56Ni and helium nuclei to within a gamma-ray mean-free-path. This requirement indicates that SNe IIb and Ib most likely arise from the explosion of stripped-envelope massive stars (main-sequence masses \\leq25Msun) that have evolved through mass-transfer in a binary system, rather than from more massive single WR stars. In contrast, the lack of HeI lines in SNe Ic may result from a variety of causes: A genuine helium deficiency; strongly-asymmetric mixing; weak mixing; or a more massive, perhaps single, progenitor characterized by a larger oxygen-rich core. Our models, subject to different mixing magnitudes, can produce a variety of SN types, including IIb, IIc, Ib, and Ic. As it is poorly constrained by explosion models, mixing challenges our ability to infer the progenitor and explosion properties of SNe IIb/Ib/Ic.",

In this contribution I focus on the mass-radius relation of CFRgs, how it can be uncovered by studying the gas expulsion phase of forming star clusters, and what the implications are. I demonstrate that, through the tidal field impact upon exposed star clusters, the CFRg mass-radius relation rules cluster infant weight-loss in dependence of cluster mass. The observational constraint of a time-invariant slope for the power-law young cluster mass function is robustly satisfied by CFRgs with a constant mean volume density. In contrast, a constant mean surface density would be conducive to the preferential destruction of high-mass clusters. A purely dynamical line-of-reasoning leads therefore to a conclusion consistent with star formation a process driven by a volume density threshold. Developing this concept further, properties of molecular clumps and CFRgs naturally get dissociated. This allows to understand: (i) why the star cluster mass function is steeper than the molecular cloud (clump) mass function/ (ii) the presence of a massive star formation limit in the mass-size space of molecular structures.",
    "fake_abstract": " The properties of cluster-forming regions (CFRs) are determined by the self-gravity induced by the total matter density, and most of them are still poorly known. We present a new method for investigating the microscopic structure in cluster-forming regions that unifies the traditional approach of the CFG model (top-down)+ the two-body relaxation (TBR) model (bottom-up). Thanks to the new method, the numerical models of local density and temperature profiles at the edge of cluster-forming regions can be easily solved by solving the TBR cool atom-molecule-molecule baryon/photon (A/M/M) equations. This reveals the local density profile close to the edge of CFR, which is comparable to the local density profile of the main body of the cluster. The local temperature profile at the edge of CFR is also close to the global cold temperature at the center of the cluster, which can be interpreted as the cold gas and cold gas halos being removed by the self-gravity, while the hot gas (main body) and hot gas halos are not affected. In addition, the local density of the cold gas and cold gas halos at the edge of CFR is comparable to the local density of the cold gas and cold gas halos in the main body of the cluster, which reduces the effect of the two-body relaxation in the cold gas at the edge of CFR. In the case of a global collapse model with an attractive cold gas, we find that the cold gas at the edge of CFR has a nonzero local density, which can be interpreted as the cold gas being maintained in the cluster when it is formed by an infalling gas. We present this work in a special section on nonlinear coupled cluster-formation models at ISPC 2010. We also apply our method to the simulation of low-mass core-collapse (LC) star-formation models."

Going beyond the results attained using the customary dynamical approach and improving also on the global criteria established within the Riemannian framework, the GIC is able to discriminate between regular and stochastic orbits on a given energy surface, simply on the basis of the value it assumes along a relatively small piece of the trajectory, without long integrations of the dynamics and without any reference to a perturbation.",

This unexpected result is beyond any standard model of modern cosmology. The new concept advanced to account for the acceleration is dark energy or quintessence with negative pressure. Most analyses using this new form of energy describe the observed data with great accuracy, although there has been no laboratory confirmation of it. The present work analyzes the consequences of Thomson scattering on Type Ia supernovae data for two significant reasons: (i) recently observed data reveal the existence of sufficient amount of ionized baryonic (hydrogen) dark matter in the intergalactic medium, a necessary ingredient for Thomson scattering, and (ii) its effects have not been considered previously in determining distances to the supernovae from their observed distance moduli. Quantitative results of the present investigation based on observed data and corrected for Thomson scattering are consistent with the prediction of Hubble expansion of the universe. Subject headings: cosmology: theory - distances and redshifts - supernovae, Hubble expansion: constituents of universe - missing dark matter",
    "fake_abstract": " Cosmological redshift and acceleration of the universe expansion are analyzed. Redshift as a Doppler shift of light from receding galaxies approximates the relativistic Doppler shift at large distances, which is responsible for the expansion of the universe. It is concluded that the basic cosmological redshift is generally positive for all galaxies, and the minimum value is determined by Hubble's law at present epoch. Redshift is usually approximated as a linear function of the distance, except at large distances, where it is considered as a power law. The minimum value of the redshift at a given epoch is determined by the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the universe, which indicates an accelerating universe. (The redshift can be considered as an Doppler shift of the local inertial frame, both at large and small distances). However, the zero-point motion of the electron causes an uncertainty in the calculated zero-point correction for the zero-point motion of photons, which causes an uncertainty in the calculated cosmological redshift. This uncertainty becomes large when the photon zero-point correction becomes small, which is the case of the most recent epoch. As the universe expands and the entropy increases, the zero-point correction becomes smaller and smaller. Therefore, the cosmological redshift is generally negative at present epoch, which can be considered as the acceleration of the universe. "

Four high-resolution Chandra observations give us a unique opportunity to study the properties of the absorbers in detail, as well as their short time-scale (days) variability. From the rich set of absorption features seen in the Chandra data, we identify two warm absorbers with column densities and ionizations that are consistent with being constant on both short and long time-scales, suggesting that those are the signatures of a rather homogeneous and extended outflow. A third absorber, ionized to a lesser degree, is also present and it replaces the strictly neutral absorber that is ubiquitously inferred from the X-ray analysis of obscured Compton-thin sources. This colder absorber appears to vary in column density on long time-scales, suggesting a non-homogeneous absorber. Moreover, its ionization responds to the nuclear luminosity variations on time-scales as short as a few days, indicating that the absorber is in photoionization equilibrium with the nuclear source on these time-scales. All components are consistent with being co-spatial and located between the inner and outer edges of the so-called dusty, clumpy torus. Assuming co-spatiality, the three phases also share the same pressure, suggesting that the warm / hot phases confine the colder, most likely clumpy, medium.

The outflowing ionization front is significantly offset from the central region, thus probably stemming from the optical disk, and is likely formed by thermal acceleration of the outflowing gas. The ionization front is associated with a complex network of low-ionization material. The outflowing plasma shows an increase of ionization with the height, indicating an increase of the outflowing plasma temperature with altitude. The observed increase of ionization with altitude may give rise to the complex network connecting outflowing and non-outflowing material, a so-called ionized X-ray outflowing column (IXOC). "

Specifically, I would like to link together: (i) the smallness of the cosmological constant today, (ii) the evolution of the universe from an inflationary era after the bigbang till now, and (iii) local supersymmetry in the gravitational sector (supergravity) with a broken spectrum at early eras, by making use of the concept of the 'running vacuum' in the context of a simple toy model of four-dimensional N = 1 supergravity. The model is characterised by dynamically broken local supersymmetry, induced by the formation of gravitino condensates in the early universe. As I will argue, there is a Starobinsky-type inflationary era characterising the broken supersymmetry phase in this model, which is compatible with the current cosmological data, provided a given constraint is satisfied among some tree-level parameters of the model and the renormalised cosmological constant of the de Sitter background used in the analysis. Applying the 'running vacuum' concept, then, to the effective field theory at the exit of inflation, makes a smooth connection (in cosmic time) with the radiation dominance epoch and subsequently with the current era of the Universe, characterised by a small (but dominant) cosmological-constant contribution to the cosmic energy density. In this approach, the smallness of the cosmological constant today is attributed to the failure (due to quantum gravity non-perturbative effects) of the aforementioned constraint.",

In a self-consistent way, it is shown that the Inflation Field is related to the energy density of the Running Vacuum and that its quantity measures its motion.

Our results reveal a rich population of stars with large variability periods, and with the potential for rapid physical and biophysical characterization. These stars are among the most rapidly evolving and chemically sensitive stellar populations in the Milky Way, and we are actively searching for more of them with the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes."

In the strangeness-zero sector we recover the known result for the in-medium nucleon–nucleon interaction. Explicit expressions for the Λ N in-medium potential in (asymmetric) nuclear matter are presented. Our results are suitable for implementation into calculations of (hyper)nuclear matter. In order to estimate the low-energy constants of the leading three-baryon forces we introduce the decuplet baryons as explicit degrees of freedom and construct the relevant terms in the minimal non-relativistic Lagrangian. With these, the constants are estimated through decuplet saturation. Utilizing this approximation we provide numerical results for the effect of the three-body force in symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter on the Λ N interaction. A moderate repulsion that increases with density is found in comparison to the free Λ N interaction.",

Two-temperature models with decoupled elemental abundances suggest that Fe is underabundant compared to the Hyades photospheric mean. In the absence of a measurement of photospheric Ne abundance in the cluster, we find Ne is overabundant compared to the solar photospheric value.

The signal is characterized by its helicity and spin-singlet excitation. We show that helicity-sensitivity, along with a simple asymptotic analysis, allows us to extract the full diphoton signal with a good accuracy. The spin-singlet excitation agrees with the predictions of standard model limits, while the helicity excess measures the difference between Standard Model and supersymmetric scenarios. We find the helicity-sensitive diphoton excess to be consistent with the Standard Model if the spin-singlet excitation is smaller than about 2. Implications for the helicity sensitivity of the diphoton excess are discussed."

The scattering is studied in the presence of an applied magnetic field which is used for spin precession of the spins within the CuO layer. We find that the spin-precessing coulombic current and spin orbit scattering are larger for electrons in the anospin than for the antin. The spin orbit scattering is significantly enhanced due to the pairing and spin-orbit coupling. The magnetic field induces an effective Zeeman shift that can be used for spin detection and determination of the spin precession angle. "

When performing phase-space integrals over such states, one would generally like to avoid putting in explicit cuts to separate soft from collinear momenta. Removing these cuts induces an overcounting of the soft-collinear region and adds new infrared-ultraviolet divergences in the collinear region. In this paper, we first present a regulator-independent subtraction algorithm for removing soft-collinear overlap at the amplitude level which may be useful in pertubative QCD. We then discuss how both the soft-collinear and infrared-ultraviolet overlaps can be undone for certain observables in a way which respects factorization. Our discussion clarifies some of the subtleties in phase-space subtractions and includes a proof of the infrared finiteness of a suitably subtracted jet function. These results complete the connection between factorized QCD and the soft-collinear effective theory.",

Steady state solutions are always subviscous with a variety of $\\Omega$ profiles which may exhibit near discontinuities. For alpha =0.01 and small viscous speeds, the boundary layer adjusted to a near steady state. A long wavelength oscillation generated by viscous overstability could be seen at times near the outer boundary. Being confined there, the boundary layer remained almost stationary. However, for alpha =0.1 and large viscous speeds, short wavelength disturbances were seen throughout which could significantly affect the power output in the boundary layer.

Timing analysis reveals a slight increase in the persistent emission pulsed fraction with energy (from 10% to 15%) up to 10 keV, above which it remains constant. The 0.5–70 keV spectra of the persistent and dip emission are the same within errors and well described by a blackbody (BB), a power-law (PL) with an exponential rolloff, a 10 keV feature, and a 6.7 keV emission feature, all modified by neutral absorption. Assuming that the BB emission originates in an accretion disk, we estimate its inner (magnetospheric) radius to be about 4 × 10(7) cm, which translates to a surface dipole field B ≈ 9 × 10(10) G. The Chandra/HETG spectrum resolves the 6.7 keV feature into (quasi-)neutral and highly ionized Fe xxv and Fe xxvi emission lines. XSTAR modeling shows these lines to also emanate from a truncated accretion disk. The burst spectra, with a peak flux more than an order of magnitude higher than Eddington, are well fit with a PL with an exponential rolloff and a 10 keV feature, with similar fit values compared to the persistent and dip spectra. The burst spectra lack a thermal component and any Fe features. Anisotropic (beamed) burst emission would explain both the lack of the BB and any Fe components.",
    "fake_abstract": " We present Chandra X-ray and Optical data for the burster,GRO J1744-28,observed by the NuSTAR and Chandra X-ray observatories during the early phase of its third outburst. The burst phase was qualitatively similar and roughly concurrent with the earlier phases of the outburst. In NuSTAR, as in earlier Chandra observations, the burst is localized as a classical black hole. The burst lasted for about 40 ksec, during which the black hole ejecta reached a power of about 1.6x10^19 erg/s. The typical sSFR was about 1x10^11 erg/s. We interpret the burst as a consequence of the failed rotational expansion of the rapidly rotating pulsar wind, driven by the emission of its magnetized, frozen core. During the burst phase the burst ejecta was concentrated in the magnetic poles of the wind; the nonspinning, magnetic poles were probably not affected. The wind was ejected at an average rate of approximately 100km/s, and the location of the burst is consistent with the magnetic poles being near the poles of the magnetized equatorial wind. In the earlier phases of the burst, the burst ejecta reached a peak optical brightness of about 0.7x10^23W cm^{-2} at the poles of the wind, while the nonmagnetic poles reached a slightly lower but still significant optical brightness of about 0.2x10^23W cm^{-2}. The length of the burst was shorter in the NuSTAR data than in earlier Chandra data."

    "title": "A Scenario for a large number of low mass black holes in the galaxy.",
    "real_abstract": "We point out that stars within a fairly large range of masses, roughly 18-30 Msun, can both explode as supernovae (and give off neutrinos as observed in SN 1987A) and then go into black holes. The masses of the black holes so formed are only slightly above 1.5 Msun, the maximum mass for compact cores, according to our arguments. These masses are substantially smaller than those of the best candidates for black holes observed thus far. We discuss the possibility that SN 1987A produced one of these small black holes. We review the requirements that observed nucleosynthesis puts on theoretical nucleosynthesis. Especially the empirical value of DeltaY/DeltaZ = 4±1.3 gives a sensitive determination of the mass at which nucleosynthesis must be cut off, by heavier stars collapsing into black holes without returning matter to the Galaxy, because otherwise heavy stars would produce chiefly metals and unduly lower the calculated value of A Y/AZ. We arrive at a value of Mcutoff = 25±5 Msun for the mass at which nucleosynthesis must be cut off. We show that the introduction of kaon condensation sufficiently softens the equation of state of dense matter, so that compact cores of mass greater than Mmax ~=Msun will not be stable. For the first &gsim;12 s, however, compact cores up to ˜1.84 Msun are stabilized; this gives the nucleosynthesis mass cutoff as ˜30 Msun, at the upper end of our limit from nucleosynthetic demands. Our soft equation of state extends black hole production to stars of lower mass than previously estimated, and, therefore, increases the estimated number of black holes by an order of magnitude or more, to ˜109 in the Galaxy.",

For the formation of a large number of present-day black holes in a galaxy of a given mass and in the presence of turbulence, a critical mass threshold is determined by the balance between the antigravitational drag produced by the turbulence field and the gravitational capture produced by the black hole's own gravitational field. For a large number of black holes the turbulence drag exceeds the gravitational capture by a small fraction, which allows the formation of a large number of black holes.

In the case of BL Lac, we detected a periodicity of ~680 days. Although the signal related to this is modest, the coincidence of the periods in both gamma and optical bands is indicative of a physical relevance. Taking into consideration previous literature results, possibly related γ-ray and optical periodicities of about one year time scale are proposed in four bright γ-ray blazars out of the ten examined in detail. Compared with results from periodicity search of optical archives of quasars, the presence of quasi-periodicities in blazars may be more frequent by a large factor.

However, the recent results of the long-term multi-epoch observations of quasars, active galaxies, tracing the structure further along the jets and following the motion of individual features for longer time, rise questions that are difficult to understand by the standard ballistic model. I.e., the ejecta are aligned with the local jet direction, instead of the core/ and within individual jets apparently inward-moving features are observed. Here we show that these unexpected phenomena, although only a small fraction among large samples, indicate the existence of non-ballistic jet motion, in which a continuous jet produces a discrete hot spot. And the precession of such a hot spot in the plane of the sky appears superluminal. Therefore, an unified and simple interpretation to the new results is obtained, which can be further tested through its predictions on the evolution of ejecta. The study is of importance in the understanding of the nature of superluminal motion, the interaction of jets and surrounding materials, as well as the common physics underlying quasars and microquasars.",

This criterion allows us to derive the basic equations for the motion, which, in turn, allow us to formulate a simple but useful solution to the Einstein field equation, which provides us with a good description of the motion for a very broad range of parameters. The solution provides a good description of the motion of all types of objects, from planets and stars to black holes and singularities. We obtain the motion from the stochastic criterion, which is independent of the nature of the force. In other words, we can derive the motion, regardless of whether gravity is discrete or continuous.

The ASCA spectra of both M82 and NGC 253 are complex with strong line emission from O, Ne, Fe, Mg, S, and Si, allowing elemental abundances to be estimated in the X-ray band for the first time in these sources. Two components are required to fit the spectra of both galaxies, with a soft component well described by a thermal model with a temperature of ~ 10^6-7 K and a hard component well described by either a thermal model (T ~ 10^8 K) or a power-law model (energy index ~ 0.8-1.0). We find that different models (with different continua) yield absolute abundances that differ by more than an order of magnitude, while relative abundances are more robust and suggest an underabundance of Fe (inferred from the Fe-L complex) relative to alpha-burning elements, possibly as a result of dust depletion. Most of the soft flux (which originates mostly within the central kpc of M82 and NGC 253) is consistent with starburst models of supernovae-heated ISM and, to a lesser extent, starburst-driven superwind emission and the direct emission from supernova (SN). The hard component in both galaxies may have some contribution from ~ 10^8 K superwind emission or individual SN, although most of the emission probably originates in point sources (most likely blackhole candidates or mini-AGN with M_Edd > 3-20 solar masses) and, possibly, inverse-Compton scattering of IR photons.

This yields some insight into the complexities encountered by Azimov in his discussion of three-particle unitarity.

    "real_abstract": "A phenomenological model for the expansion of a quark-gluon plasma is presented and applied to ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. The flavour kinetics is described by rate equations allowing the abundances of the different constituents of the system to be out of equilibrium. The basic constituents are the quarks and gluons in the plasma phase and hadrons in the hadronic phase. Besides ordinary kinetic processes within the two phases (inelastic collisions), we construct a model for the confinement mechanism which is based on the string phenomenology of hadronization. The latter aspect constitutes the novel and essential part of the paper. Abundances of the various hadrons have been calculated for a baryon-poor and a baryon-rich scenario. The results show that during the hadronization process, the original quark content is roughly doubled. The resulting hadron abundances are found to depend on the hadronization mechanism, while the subsequent hadronic reactions do not have a significant effect on the final hadronic abundances. We find a K − π − ratio as much as a factor 6 larger than in pp̄ collisions.",

This assumption is supported by recent experiments that have observed the disappearance of the quark chirality with the suppression of the dissociation width. We find the leading order quark-flavor kinetics in the universality class of the axial-vector expansion order parameter. We show that the lowest order quark-flavor kinetics of the leading order expansion order parameter μ̄(p) are given by the symmetric-exponential function in the case of the slow quark-mixing rate, and in the limit of infinite axial dimension the leading-order (1/4)exp(−μ̄(p)−γ) function can be used.

We compute two new (topologically protected) types of contributions to the entropy in this system resulting from this dynamics. The first contribution has a negative sign, expressed in terms of the magnetic susceptibility, and it is similar in spirit to topological entanglement entropy discussed in condensed matter systems. The second contribution with a positive sign results from the emergent degeneracy which occurs when the system is placed into a background of external magnetic field. This degeneracy resembles a similar effect that occurs at θ=π in topological insulators. Based on these computations we claim that the Maxwell system defined on the four torus behaves in many respects as a topologically ordered system.",

Although the emission spectrum produced by intervening clouds is identical to the standard BLR model, they may produce absorption features on the optical or UV continuum. Single clouds will have little effect on the optical/UV spectrum because BLR clouds are likely to be much smaller than the accretion disk. This is unlike the X-ray case, where the radiation source is considerably smaller. However, an ensemble of intervening clouds will produce spectroscopic features in the FUV including a strong depression between the Lyman limit and Ly{\\alpha}.

Such modelling needs to be achieved in two dimensions, combining the calculation of the structure of the star, its mean flows and the time-evolution of the whole. We present here a first step in this challenging programme. It leads to the first self-consistent two-dimensional models of rotating stars in a steady state generated by the ESTER code. In these models the structure (pressure, density and temperature) and the flow fields are computed in a self-consistent way allowing the prediction of the differential rotation and the associated meridian circulation of the stars. After a presentation of the physical properties of such models and the numerical methods at work, we give the first grid of such models describing massive and intermediate-mass stars for a selection of rotation rates up to 90% of the breakup angular velocity.",

The final models are evolved, following the prescription of stars following the same evolutionary track as their initial ones, in order to evaluate their atmospheric evolution. We find, in agreement with the SPH results, that the main role in the chemical evolution of rotating, as opposed to non-rotating, stars, is played by supernovae explosions, and that the stability of the models is largely related to the initial composition of the stars.

Moreover, in the combined limit these heavy pentaquark states fill multiplets of SU(4)xO(8)xSU(2). We explore the question of whether corrections in the combined 1/Nc and 1/mQ expansions are sufficiently small to maintain this qualitative result. Since no model-independent way is known to answer this question, we use a class of ``realistic'' hadronic models in which a pentaquark can be formed via nucleon-heavy meson binding through a pion-exchange potential. These models have the virtue that they necessarily yield the correct behavior in the combined limit, and the long-distance parts of the interactions are model independent. If the long-distance attraction in these models were to predict bound states in a robust way (i.e., largely insensitive to the details of the short-range interaction), then one could safely conclude that heavy pentaquarks do exist. However, in practice the binding does depend very strongly on the details of the short-distance physics, suggesting that the real world is not sufficiently near the combined large Nc, mQ limit to use it as a reliable guide. Whether stable heavy pentaquarks exist remains an open question.",

Gas accretion from a thin disk limits the black-hole spin to chi_gas < 0.9980 +- 0.0002, as electromagnetic radiation from this disk with retrograde angular momentum is preferentially absorbed by the black hole. Extrapolation of numerical-relativity simulations of equal-mass binary black-hole mergers to maximum initial spins suggests these mergers yield a maximum spin chi_eq < 0.95. Here we show that for smaller mass ratios q = m/M << 1, the superradiant extraction of angular momentum from the larger black hole imposes a fundamental limit chi_lim < 0.9979 +- 0.0001 on the final black-hole spin even in the test-particle limit q -> 0 of binary black-hole mergers. The nearly equal values of chi_gas and chi_lim imply that measurement of supermassive black-hole spins cannot distinguish a black hole built by gas accretion from one assembled by the gravitational inspiral of a disk of compact stellar remnants. We also show how superradiant scattering alters the mass and spin predicted by models derived from extrapolating test-particle mergers to finite mass ratios.",

This leads to a larger black hole spin and an enhanced frequency of tidal disruptions. We show that the mass of the tidal disruption companion can be tuned by quasi-circular binary (QCB) mergers and discuss their origin. We also show that a rigorous calculation can also be done to determine the maximum black hole spin and mass of the black hole merger remnant, based on the specific formation history of QCBs.

    "title": "Collective neutrino flavor transitions in supernovae and the role of trajectory averaging.",
    "real_abstract": "Non-linear effects on supernova neutrino oscillations, associated with neutrino self-interactions, are known to induce collective flavor transitions near the supernova core for theta_13 \\neq 0. In scenarios with very shallow electron density profiles, these transformations have been shown to couple with ordinary matter effects, jointly producing spectral distortions both in normal and inverted hierarchy. In this work we consider a complementary scenario, characterized by higher electron density, as indicated by post-bounce shock-wave simulations. In this case, early collective flavor transitions are decoupled from later, ordinary matter effects. Moreover, such transitions become more amenable to both numerical computations and analytical interpretations in inverted hierarchy, while they basically vanish in normal hierarchy. We numerically evolve the neutrino density matrix in the region relevant for self-interaction effects. In the approximation of averaged intersection angle between neutrino trajectories, our simulations neatly show the collective phenomena of synchronization, bipolar oscillations, and spectral split, recently discussed in the literature. In the more realistic (but computationally demanding) case of non-averaged neutrino trajectories, our simulations do not show new significant features, apart from the smearing of ``fine structures'' such as bipolar nutations. Our results seem to suggest that, at least for non-shallow matter density profiles, averaging over neutrino trajectories plays a minor role in the final outcome. In this case, the swap of nu_e and nu_{\\mu,\\tau} spectra above a critical energy may represent an unmistakable signature of the inverted hierarchy, especially for theta_{13} small enough to render further matter effects irrelevant.",

This effect seems to be more prominent in SNe II than in SNe I. We also give some indications on the dependence of the average neutrino trajectory length on the type and luminosity of the of the SN.

The columns of ILC produced during a single LPM event are on the order of 10^16^^^ cm. In the present analysis the equivalent mass of the ILC involved in the LPM events (using the flux of the ionosphere-thermosphere electron spectrum) is on the order of 10^11^^^ cm^-1^.

The largest H I line emission occurs in the cluster Abell 2052, which has a central concentration equal to the mass of the Milky Way and a total mass of the cluster of ~ 10^7 solar masses. The cool gas emission is found to be in simple ``cold bubble'' models that are similar to the gas confined by the dark matter in the halos of galaxies. The cold bubble models predict that the gas in the cold bubble should be optically thin. The cold bubble in Abell 2052 is optically thick, with a mass-to-mass optical depth of ~ 2. This indicates that the cold bubble has been heated to high temperatures by the contraction of the diffuse gas in the cluster. Local density measurements of the cold bubble reveal that it is overpressured, implying that the cold bubble is supported by the cold, diffuse gas in the cluster. A global $-2\\mbox{kpc}$ absorption at the cool bubble radius is not seen, and may be due to a residual gas between the cold bubble and the observer."

Overall, we find line profiles reaching from doubly peaked symmetric emission to symmetric Voigt (absorption) in static configurations with increasing dust content, and asymmetric red-(blue-) shifted emission lines with a blue (red) counterpart ranging from absorption to emission (with increasing line/continuum strength) in expanding (infalling) media. The following results are of interest for the interpretation of lya profiles from galaxies. 1/ Standard lya absorption line fitting of global spectra of galaxies may lead to an underestimate of the true hydrogen column density in certain geometrical conditions. 2/ Normal (inverted) P-Cygni like lya profiles can be obtained in expanding (infalling) media from objects without any intrinsic lya emission, as a natural consequence of radiation transfer effects. 3/ The formation and the detailed shape of lya profiles resulting from expanding shells has been thoroughly revised: for sufficiently large column densities, the position of the main lya emission peak is redshifted by twice the expansion velocity.This is in excellent agreement with the observations of z~3 LBGs.

Here we consider the mechanisms that drive the evolution of the Lyα line profiles observed in both the nearby and distant universe. We focus on the Lyα line at 0.064 μm in the Lyman-α forest, which is strongly absorbed by hydrogen, and the Lyα line at 0.155 μm, which is strongly absorbed by neutral helium. This spectral line profile evolution is examined through a macroscopic, locally-induced evolution, which we refer to as the transfer model. Examples of the evolution of the profiles for various metallicities and redshifts are presented, and a discussion of the evolution of the profile shape is added. We show that the evolution can be described by a simple transfer model, where expansion of the universe is followed by a smooth evolution of the absorption strength of hydrogen and helium to the present day. We present results as well as discussion of the evolution of the profile shape, in particular the rapid growth of the Lyα 0.155 μm absorption strength as the absorption strength of hydrogen decreases. We suggest that the increase of the absorption strength is due to the growth of absorption at shorter wavelengths than the Lyα 0.064 μm line. "

For a specific tuning of the dyonic charges one can reach a domain where the low energy absorption probability goes to zero with inverse powers of the logarithm of the energy. This is a dividing domain between the regime where the low energy absorption probability approaches zero with positive powers of energy and the regime where the probability is an oscillatory function of the logarithm of the energy.

With these transitions, we suppress the diffuse low density emission in the nuclear region. We detect and resolve the individual compact giant molecular cloud associations (GMAs) in the 1.4 kpc circumnuclear starburst ring and within the 350 pc nuclear region. The nucleus is brighter than the ring in both lines, and contributes to ~20% and ~30% to the total detected HCO+(J = 3-2) and HCN(J = 3-2) flux, within the central 1.4 kpc.

We present a line profile fitting analysis of the widths of the resolved HCO and HCN lines, which clearly distinguish the case of a nuclear magnetic field from their absence. We find that, if we adopt the assumption of upflow of HCO in the nuclear region, the line profile of HCO is reduced by a factor of ∼2.5, whereas the line profile of HCN is not significantly changed. Because of the large line width of HCN, any reduction of the profile width is easily detected by the resolution. We find no evidence of upflow of HCO in the nuclear region, except for the case of an axisymmetric magnetic field. Our results suggest that upflow of HCO is a viable scenario only in the presence of a weak axisymmetric magnetic field in the nuclear region. Our results also suggest that the ratio of the line strengths of HCN(J = 3-2) to HCO(J = 3-2) is not a good measure of the local environment of the nucleus. "

The models differ in terms of the convection processes, magnetic and thermal structure, and age of the stellar interior. The authors then determine the atmospheric parameters for the two models and compare the resulting p-factors. The mean p-factor for the two models is 0.22, with the difference between them being on the order of 0.03. The authors show that by using the fact that the p-factors of the models are essentially identical, they can construct the p-factor relation without making any assumptions about the evolution of the stellar interior. They also use this method to determine the p-factor relations for a sample of ~300 solar-type stars. The results are consistent with previous determinations of p-factor relations based on observations. "

It is shown that the empirical systematics of these deviations displays a strong mass dependence, that the interacting boson approximation successfully reproduces these systematic trends, and does so primarily by virtue of the variations in boson number and not because of parameter variations. Moreover, the origin of the N dependence lies in the characteristic way in which the SU(3) symmetry is broken in calculations for realistic deformed nuclei and involves, in an essential way, the N dependence of the SU(3) γ→β transitions.\nNUCLEAR STRUCTURE Interacting boson model, finite boson number effects, relation to geometric models.",

The optical photometric system has been designed to maximize the number of objects with accurate classification by SED and redshift, and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission lines. The observations are being carried out with the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope using the cameras LAICA and O-2000. The first data confirm that we are reaching the expected magnitude limits of AB<~25 mag in the optical filters from the blue to 8300 A, and from AB=24.7 to 23.4 for the redder ones. The limit in the NIR is (Vega) K_s~20, H~21, J~22. We expect to obtain accurate redshift values, Delta z/(1+z) <~ 0.03 for about 5x10^5 galaxies with I<~25 (60% complete), and z_med=0.74.

Generalizing an existing finiteness result, we provide a concise proof of finiteness of the partition function associated to all non-degenerate triangulations of 4-manifolds and for a class of degenerate triangulations not previously shown. This is accomplished by a suitable re-factoring and re-ordering of integration, through which a large set of variables can be eliminated. The resulting formulation can be interpreted as a ``dual variables'' model that uses hyperboloid variables associated to spin foam edges in place of representation variables associated to faces. We outline how this method may also be useful for numerical computations, which have so far proven to be very challenging for Lorentzian spin foam models.",

It is shown that this generalizes the classical cases of finite metric tensor and finite metric solution. We also find an explicit form for the dual variables in the cases of (1). A simple example leads to some useful results regarding duality. Remarkably, this leads to a notion of duality in the finite case, although we do not derive it in detail. "

In the nonlinear regime, dispersion estimates based on a simple diffusion approximation fail due to a strong nonlinear drift effect. We give some simple numerical examples to support this result. We apply our results to a double inflation model and show that estimates of the probability of successful inflation depend on a correct treatment of nonlinear effects. Including them greatly reduces the amount of fine-tuning necessary in this model.",

Spectroscopic data is used to better estimate the internal reddening within the galaxy which is found to be highly variable and to calculate metallicity which is close to the solar value. Diagnostic diagram identifies the shocked regions within this galaxy.

The lack of emission lines of the brightest star-forming galaxies is compelling evidence that they are formed by mergers and not by the steady accretion process of a disk-like accretion of cold gas. The lack of a narrow FUV line is also seen in the FUSE data with the exception of NGC 4889, which has a low fraction of unobserved stars. Our result is consistent with the interpretation that star formation is triggered by mergers through the rapid inflow of cold gas to the central region.

Our calculations focus on linear perturbations of background equilibria in which the two fluids move together, the total density is uniform, and the densities of the two components are proportional to one another, with ratios that are independent of position. The motions of the two fluids are coupled by mutual friction, as formulated by Khalatnikov. We show that there are two general classes of modes for small perturbations: one class in which the two fluids move together and the other in which there is relative motion between them. The former are identical to the modes found for a single fluid, except that the rate of viscous dissipation, when computed in the secular (or ``low Reynolds number'') approximation under the assumption of a constant kinematic viscosity, is diminished by a factor $f_N$, the fraction of the total mass in the normal fluid. The relative modes are completely new, and are studied in detail for a range of values for the phenomenological mutual friction coefficients, relative densities of the superfluid and normal components, and, for Roche ellipsoids, binary mass ratios. We find that there are no new secular instabilities connected with the relative motions of the two fluid components.

Simulations were performed of measurements with a dedicated thin-window parallel-plate ion chamber near a high-Zinterface in a60Co photon beam (Nilssonet al1992Med. Phys.191413–21). Good agreement was obtained between simulations and measurements for a detailed set of experiments in which the thickness of the ion chamber window, the thickness of the air gap between ion chamber and heterogeneity, the depth of the ion chamber in polystyrene and the material of the interface was varied.

It was found that using the new electron transport algorithm in EGSnrc, including relativistic spin effects in elastic scattering, significantly affects the calculation of dose distribution near high-Zinterfaces. The simulations were found to be independent of the maximum fractional electron energy loss per step (ESTEPE), which was often a cause for concern in older EGS4 simulations. Concerning the new features of the photon transport algorithm sampling of the photoelectron angular distribution was found to have a significant effect, whereas the effect of binding energies in Compton scatter was found to be negligible.

Unusually deep, high signal-to-noise images of M87 are used to measure the effective and limiting radii of approximately 2000 globular clusters. To compare with these observations, we simulate a globular cluster population that has the same characteristics as the observed M87 cluster population. Placing these simulated clusters in the well-studied tidal field of M87, the orbit of each cluster is solved and the theoretical tidal radius of each cluster is determined. We compare the predicted relationship between cluster size and projected galactocentric distance to observations. We find that for an isotropic distribution of cluster velocities, theoretical tidal radii are approximately equal to observed limiting radii for Rgc < 10 kpc. However, the isotropic simulation predicts a steep increase in cluster size at larger radii, which is not observed in large galaxies beyond the Milky Way. To minimize the discrepancy between theory and observations, we explore the effects of orbital anisotropy on cluster sizes, and suggest a possible orbital anisotropy profile for M87 which yields a better match between theory and observations.

The required axion coupling to the QCD anomaly comes from the 5D Chern-Simons coupling, and all other unwanted U(1)_{PQ} breaking axion couplings can be avoided naturally by the 5D gauge symmetry of C_M and the 5D locality. If the fifth dimension is warped, the resulting axion scale is suppressed by small warp factor compared to the Planck scale, thereby the model can generate naturally an intermediate axion scale f_a=10^{10} - 10^{12}GeV.",
    "fake_abstract": " The four dimensional axion is the only charged vector particle to appear in both quantum field theory and quantum gravity, but the theory of axions is much less developed than ordinary field theory. In this paper a higher dimensional version of the axion is derived by taking the generalization of the quark model by Kaluza, Klein and Spencer to higher dimensional gauge field. The requirements of the model are given. By combining this model with the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in higher dimensions one can derive the axion. "

This Hamiltonian picture can be used to compare directly with many-body spectra of fermions at unitarity on harmonic traps, thereby providing a direct physical interpretation of the holographic radial coordinate for these systems.

We investigate the spectrum of $h$ as well as $F$ in several versions of AdS/CFT. We show that the operator $h$ can be interpreted naturally as the operator for the function $h$ as the product of a $CP$-polytope with the operator $O_3$ on the space $CP$^3.

We develop a general method for calculating $h$ in a way which does not depend on the value of $CP$. We also explain the procedure which we use to calculate $h$ in the sense of general AdS/CFT. A concrete application of our method is given to calculate $h$ in the sense of AdS/CFT with a constant $CP$-invariant. We give an example which is not found in the literature. "

    "title": "The EChO science case.",
    "real_abstract": "The discovery of almost two thousand exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverse planet population. We see gas giants in few-day orbits, whole multi-planet systems within the orbit of Mercury, and new populations of planets with masses between that of the Earth and Neptune—all unknown in the Solar System. Observations to date have shown that our Solar System is certainly not representative of the general population of planets in our Milky Way. The key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore: What are exoplanets made of? Why are planets as they are? How do planetary systems work and what causes the exceptional diversity observed as compared to the Solar System? The EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory) space mission was conceived to take up the challenge to explain this diversity in terms of formation, evolution, internal structure and planet and atmospheric composition. This requires in-depth spectroscopic knowledge of the atmospheres of a large and well-defined planet sample for which precise physical, chemical and dynamical information can be obtained. In order to fulfil this ambitious scientific program, EChO was designed as a dedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of observing a large, diverse and well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission lifetime. The transit and eclipse spectroscopy method, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allows us to measure atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of at least 10$^{−4}$ relative to the star. This can only be achieved in conjunction with a carefully designed stable payload and satellite platform. It is also necessary to provide broad instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect as many molecular species as possible, to probe the thermal structure of the planetary atmospheres and to correct for the contaminating effects of the stellar photosphere. This requires wavelength coverage of at least 0.55 to 11 μm with a goal of covering from 0.4 to 16 μm. Only modest spectral resolving power is needed, with R ~ 300 for wavelengths less than 5 μm and R ~ 30 for wavelengths greater than this. The transit spectroscopy technique means that no spatial resolution is required. A telescope collecting area of about 1 m$^{2}$ is sufficiently large to achieve the necessary spectro-photometric precision: for the Phase A study a 1.13 m$^{2}$ telescope, diffraction limited at 3 μm has been adopted. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a cold and stable thermal environment as well as a large field of regard to allow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed over the sky. EChO has been conceived to achieve a single goal: exoplanet spectroscopy. The spectral coverage and signal-to-noise to be achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability and dedicated design, would be a game changer by allowing atmospheric composition to be measured with unparalleled exactness: at least a factor 10 more precise and a factor 10 to 1000 more accurate than current observations. This would enable the detection of molecular abundances three orders of magnitude lower than currently possible and a fourfold increase from the handful of molecules detected to date. Combining these data with estimates of planetary bulk compositions from accurate measurements of their radii and masses would allow degeneracies associated with planetary interior modelling to be broken, giving unique insight into the interior structure and elemental abundances of these alien worlds. EChO would allow scientists to study exoplanets both as a population and as individuals. The mission can target super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures of 300–3000 K) of F to M-type host stars. The EChO core science would be delivered by a three-tier survey. The EChO Chemical Census: This is a broad survey of a few-hundred exoplanets, which allows us to explore the spectroscopic and chemical diversity of the exoplanet population as a whole. The EChO Origin: This is a deep survey of a subsample of tens of exoplanets for which significantly higher signal to noise and spectral resolution spectra can be obtained to explain the origin of the exoplanet diversity (such as formation mechanisms, chemical processes, atmospheric escape). The EChO Rosetta Stones: This is an ultra-high accuracy survey targeting a subsample of select exoplanets. These will be the bright “benchmark” cases for which a large number of measurements would be taken to explore temporal variations, and to obtain two and three dimensional spatial information on the atmospheric conditions through eclipse-mapping techniques. If EChO were launched today, the exoplanets currently observed are sufficient to provide a large and diverse sample. The Chemical Census survey would consist of > 160 exoplanets with a range of planetary sizes, temperatures, orbital parameters and stellar host properties. Additionally, over the next 10 years, several new ground- and space-based transit photometric surveys and missions will come on-line (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems. The current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be further optimised in the years prior to EChO’s launch and enable the atmospheric characterisation of hundreds of planets.",

This briefing describes the science case for each experiment in the TTP. The TTP is a large programme for high-energy physics and is expected to cost about €1 billion per year, including the cost of the experiments themselves and their building.

A detailed plan to make the HLUT a reality is explained in this briefing. The science case is based on experts’ judgments of the number of physics experiments that can be done and the effect of those experiments on our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and the forces of Nature. The judgments of the number of physics experiments can be reasonably simple to assess, and the experts are not necessarily experts in physics. However, the effects of the physics experiments in our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and the forces of Nature are harder to assess precisely.

The associated spherical formulation for diagramatic evaluations reveals a non-trivial effect which the topology of the manifold has on the vacuum processes and which ultimately dissociates the dynamical behaviour of the quantised field from its behaviour in the absence of a boundary.

    "real_abstract": "The neutrino mass matrix is constraint considering in a three-generation scenario, which includes or excludes LSND and considers the atmospheric neutrinos of Super-Kamiokande and the solar neutrino experiments. In this way one is able to construct the neutrino mass matrix, up to a mass scale and up to the Majorana neutrino CP eigenvalues. By using the expectation value of the electron neutrino mass obtained in the neutrinoless double beta decay, one can derive an upper limit of 2.53 [eV] for the sum of the masses of the three neutrinos. In a second part we use the R violating minimal supersymmetric model ( R -MSSM) to construct the neutrino mass matrix. The contributions on the tree level yield by mixing with the neutralinos (photino, zino, higgsino 1 and higgsino 2) a separable 3 · 3 mass matrix, which has two mass eigenvalues, which are zero and a third eigenvalue different from zero. This yields a hierachichal structure of two neutrinos with small masses and a third neutrino with a larger mass. If one includes the loop diagrams of quarks and SUSY quarks and of leptons and SUSY leptons one obtains for the three neutrinos a sum of tree separable matrices. Such a separable mass matrix of rank 3 has 9 independent parameters. One can fit five parameters from the neutrino oscillations: the three mixing angles of the matrix transforming the neutrinos from the mass eigenstates to the weak eigenstates and the two differences of the squared masses. One therefore has to reduce the nine free parameters of the mass matrix in the R -MSSM from nine to five. This is possible imposing a constraint on the cubic couplings employing an additional U (1) flavour symmetry. This approach has been very successful in studying the Yukawa couplings to fix the masses of the quarks and the non-neutrino leptons. In this way it is possible to reduce the R-parity violating coupling constants of the the R -MSSM from six to one. This reduces the free parameters of the neutrino mass matrix obtained in the SUSY model to four. We find in a three-family mixing scheme an averaged Majorana neutrino mass, which in principle can be obtained from the neutrinoless double beta decay, of | 〈 m 〉 | = 0.009 to 0.045[ eV ]. These predictions can perhaps be tested by the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.",

This paper reports on multiepoch ultraviolet searches of five GRB positions with HST. We found no sources with significant ultraviolet excesses, variability, parallax, or proper motion in any of the burst error regions. In particular, we see no sources similar to that proposed as a counterpart to the GRB970228. While this negative result is disappointing, it still has good utility for its strict limits on the no-host-galaxy problem in cosmological models of GRBs. For most cosmological models (with peak luminosity 6X10^50 erg/s), the absolute B magnitude of any possible host galaxy must be fainter than -15.5 to -17.4.

The discussion is restricted to the limit of zero beta, for which the vacuum energy is given by the Heisenberg equation. We analyse the form of the effective action at the origin of the horizon. Stabilizing the action at this point leads to explicit equations of motion.

We find that the only phase space region where the differential cross section is large enough to obtain a positive CP asymmetry is the region of $η=1$, while in the region of $η\\sim 0$ the differential cross section is $≤1/2$. The only possibility is that a CP violation in the decay takes place in the region of the $η−1/2$, since this region is the only one where the differential cross section exceeds $0.5$, while the differential cross section in the region of $η = 1$ is $≤0.5$."

We concentrate on the projected correlation function w(r_p), which is directly related to the real space \\xi(r). The amplitude of w(r_p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeply above the characteristic luminosity L_*. Redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation amplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the luminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red galaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies more strongly clustered at small scales. We interpret these results using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models assuming concordance cosmological parameters. For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits the w(r_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r_p ~ 1-3 Mpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of \\xi(r). The implied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminosity threshold L grows as M_min ~ L at low luminosities and more steeply above L_*. The mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M_1 ~ 23 M_min(L). These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at fixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function extrapolation of the satellite population. HOD models nicely explain the joint luminosity-color dependence of w(r_p) in terms of the color fractions of central and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. The inferred HOD properties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.",

    "real_abstract": "We present theoretical and observational studies of strong gravitational lenses produced by clusters of galaxies. Our purpose is to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model at small and highly non-linear scales where it has been claimed that the CDM model may confront several difficulties. We concentrate our attention on the statistics of strong gravitational lenses. We use two complementary statistics, lensed arcs and quasars, to probe the mass distributions. First, we construct a triaxial lens model, and develop a new method to include triaxiality of dark halos in the lens statistics. We find that the effect of triaxiality is significant: it enhances lensing probabilities by a factors of a few to ten, assuming the degree of triaxiality predicted in the CDM model. In particular, we argue that both central concentration and large triaxiality of dark halos are required to reproduce the observed number of arcs in clusters: thus the result can be interpreted as a strong evidence for the cold and collisionless dark matter. One of the most notable advantages of the triaxial modeling is that the triaxial modeling allows us to predict image multiplicities. We find that the CDM halos predict significant fraction (more than 20%) of naked cusp lenses. In addition, we point out the image multiplicities depend strongly on the central concentration of dark halos. Therefore we propose image multiplicities as a new powerful test of the CDM model. Finally we searched for large-separation lensed quasars from the data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and succeeded in discovering the first large-separation lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112. We find that the discovery of the large-separation quadruple lens SDSS J1004+4112 is quite consistent with the theoretical predictions based on the CDM model. (Abridged)",

The size of lensing caused by the Earth's motion through a lensing filament is proportional to the length of the filament, $\\geq$ the radius of the Earth. However, the lensing power of these lenses is strongly suppressed by the geometric distortion that they undergo in the lensing medium. We calculate the lensing power of cold dark matter halos that pass through the Earth and estimate the lensing power of lenses generated at the Earth's surface. We find that the lensing power of lenses generated at the Earth's surface is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the actual lensing power of these lenses. This result provides a conservative upper bound on the actual lensing power of gravitational lenses. We also present numerical simulations of lensing by halos passing through the Earth that demonstrate that the lensing power of these lenses is suppressed by the geometric distortion of the halos in the lensing medium. Our results suggest that in a cold dark matter universe lensing by cold dark matter halos in the lensing medium is rather insignificant and that lensing by cold dark matter halos at large distances is suppressed by the gravitational distortion of the cold dark matter halos in the lensing medium.

The dust in the OAF is unrelated to the diffuse gas in the galaxy, which is thought to be stripped from the galaxies by the wind from the system's central galaxy, and is coeval with the OAF. In the 1980s, the MUSE instrument on the Very Large Telescope observed the system at optical and near-infrared wavelengths and detected an east-west streaking feature which is not due to the OAF but is probably due to a foreground disc. Combining the optical and near-infrared observations with the new near-infrared observations allows us to distinguish the OAF from the disc.

The approach is confronted with low-energy and lattice data. One can notice that, in the different examples studied here, high-dimension condensates are expected to deviate largely from their vacuum saturation (large N_c) values, while the new 1/Q^2-term due to \\lambda^2 solves the hadronic mass scale hierarchy-puzzle encountered in the early SVZ-sum rule analysis and improves the low-energy phenomenology. From tau-decay data, one can extract the running strange quark mass m_s(2 GeV)=(93^{+29}_{-32}) MeV and a more accurate value of the QCD coupling \\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.117+- 0.002.",
    "fake_abstract": " The SVZ-expansion conjecture is a key prediction of current models of cortical function at a microscopic level. This review concentrates on the experimental evidence accumulated over the last decade, emphasising recent progress. First, it is shown that the hypothesis can be tested by studying the stratum oriens in living animals, thus providing a novel framework for direct electrophysiological study of the biology of incoming information in the cortex. Second, recent work has definitely confirmed the existence of a SVZ-expansion effect, whereas a previously reported failure of this effect at the level of head-direction cells requires a reinterpretation of the original data. The existence of SVZ-expansion is also supported by direct measurement of dendritic spines in the thalamus and cerebellum. In particular, it is shown that the expansion of cerebellar output to the neocortex is accompanied by the acquisition of a steeply ascending, first-order divergence of cerebellar output, a finding that supports previous evidence that cerebellar spines target cortical sensory areas. Third, the predictive power of the SVZ-expansion hypothesis is brought into focus by comparisons with other models of cortical function, in particular the \"bundle-switching\" model. Finally, the review addresses the question of how the SVZ-expansion hypothesis can be extended to account for the evidence for a local SVZ-expansion effect in primates and other mammals, including humans. It is proposed that a nonlinear expansion, with a wave shape that depends on initial residence time and direction of arrival at the thalamus, is a reasonable extension of the SVZ-expansion hypothesis.

This formalism determines the Majorana mass matrix in terms of quark mass matrices. Adopting three different sets of quark mass matrices that produce acceptable fermion mass ratios and Cabibbo mixing, we obtain results consistent with the above; however, in the optimum case, νe−νμ mixing can be of the order of the Cabibbo angle.

    "title": "Near-field approximation for strong gravitational fields.",

The restrictions, placed by Einstein's equations, on the time dependence of the \"multipole moments\" of a system which is isolated from other bodies of empty space are exhibited. These restrictions are statements of the global conservation of energy and linear momentum. In Newtonian theory they would state that, for an isolated system, (ddt)A0=0 and (d2dt2)A1=0 where A0, A1 are multipole moments. The principal assumption made in this paper is simply that a near-field zone exists for the systems which we consider (i.e., Lλ<1). We do not, in any sense, assume that the gravitational fields are weak. The contracted Bianchi identity G0ν;ν≡0 plays a crucial role in the analysis since it implies, for a quasistationary system, that if the empty-space field equations Gμν=0 are obeyed in order n, then [(−g)12G0i],i=0 is obeyed in order n+1. This in turn implies the existence of a vanishing surface integral which restricts the time dependence of the quasistationary field in each order. It is shown that there are close similarities between strong gravitational fields and electromagnetic fields in the near-field approximation. For example, just as the first effect of a quasistatic electromagnetic field is to induce a magnetic field, so the first effect of a quasistatic gravitational field is to induce a magneticlike field, whose potentials are g0i.",

We show that this divergence of the Compton scattering amplitudes implies that the asymptotic region of the ghost wave function converges to a asymptotically constant wave function. We prove that this asymptotic wave function is entirely contained in the wave packet of the complex scalar field.

Consequently, there exist rays, emitted soon after the BB, that will reach later observers with finite blueshift (-1<z<0). But in spacetimes without symmetry there are no radial directions. The question thus arises whether blueshifts can exist at all in the Szekeres models that contain L–T as a limit, but in general have no symmetry. The aim of the present paper is to show that strong blueshifts can be generated in quasispherical Szekeres (QSS) models. It is shown that in an axially symmetric QSS model, infinite blueshift can appear only on axial rays, which intersect every space orthogonal to the dust flow on the symmetry axis. In an exemplary QSS model it is numerically shown that if such a ray is emitted from the Big Bang where dtB/dr≠0, then indeed observers see it with z≈-1. Rays emitted shortly after the BB and running close to the symmetry axis will reach the observers with a strong blueshift, too. Then, in a toy QSS model that has no symmetry, it was shown by numerical calculations that two null lines exist such that rays in their vicinity have redshift profiles similar to those in a vicinity of the axial rays in the axially symmetric case.

    "real_abstract": "The mysterious radiation ... entering our atmosphere from above discovered by Hess in 1912 is now known to be dominated by relativistic charged particles, mostly with energies in the GeV-range, but extending to energies higher by many orders of magnitude. As none of these particles can penetrate the earths atmosphere without interaction, detailed studies of their composition and energy spectra require observations with high-altitude balloons or spacecraft. This became possible only towards the middle of the 20th century. The direct measurements have now revealed much detail about the Galactic cosmic rays below 10(15)eV, but do not yet provide much overlap with the air-shower region of energies. A historic overview of the measurements is given, beginning with the realization that the majority of the cosmic rays are protons. The discovery and astrophysical significance of the heavier nuclei, and of the ultra-heavy nuclei beyond iron and up to the actinides, are then described, and measurements of the isotopic composition are discussed. Observations of the individual energy spectra are reviewed, and finally, the detection of electrons, positrons, and anti-protons in the cosmic rays, and the searches for exotic or unusual phenomena are summarized. Emphasis is given to the fact that all of these discoveries have become possible through the evolution of increasingly sophisticated detection techniques, a process that is continuing through the present time. The precise knowledge of the abundance distributions of the elements in the cosmic rays and of their isotopic composition permits a comparison with the universal abundance scale and provides strong constraints on the origin of the cosmic-ray material in the interstellar medium. Clock-isotopes reveal the time history of the particles. The shapes of the energy spectra of the individual cosmic-ray components are related to evolving ideas about particle acceleration and propagation in the Galaxy. In conclusion, prospects for future work are briefly discussed.",

The results from the first year of operation have been presented and a map of the spectral index at energies of 500 to 1500 GeV has been made at the Tevatron.

In this paper we report on work following this third approach. We derive the double differential cross section for a collision with transverse momentum transfer P$_t$ and longitudinal momentum transfer P$_{\\ell}$ from a knowledge of the UV and x-ray photoabsorption cross section of the medium, together with the known kinematics and dynamics of the scattering of point charges with screening.

The model attempts to unify flavor, color, and hypercolor, and provide a multigenerational grand unified theory. It predicts SU(4) as the unique unitary group for hypercolor. With the fundamental fermions belonging to the (16, 10) ⊕ (10, 16) irreducible representation of SO(10)V×SO(10)H, there are exactly four generations of ordinary fermions (hypercolor singlets). The dynamical symmetry breaking which gives masses to the vector bosons of the standard electroweak theory is accomplished through the condensates of a single generation of hyperfermions belonging to the sextet of SU(4). We show that the Weinberg relation MW=MZcosθ will be satisfied provided the hypercolor dynamics satisfies certain constraints. Present in the model are the much desired extended-hypercolor gauge bosons whose radiative transitions between the ordinary fermions and the hyperfermions give rise to both masses and mixing of the ordinary fermions; hence the generalized Cabibbo angles are in principle calculable. We also analyze the pseudo-Goldstone bosons and the rare decay modes of the K and D mesons. With the hyperfermions in the TeV range and the extended gauge bosons in the 1000-TeV range, we show that there is no conflict in the model with any known experimental bounds on such decays.

We evaluate the coupling of virtual Compton scattering to the hadron modes of arbitrary lower-order derivative to show that the vacuum polarization is nonzero at all nonvanishing virtual Compton angle. The results show that virtual Compton scattering occurs at low-energies, finite virtual Compton angle, and that the vacuum polarization at low-energies is larger than at higher-energies. We show that although the virtual Compton angle of virtual Compton scattering is independent of the virtual Compton angle of the photon, the virtual Compton angle of virtual Compton scattering is reduced by the virtual Compton angle of the photon. We discuss the role of virtuality in the total cross section. "

Extensive numerical simulations of velocity dispersion determinations from integrated light spectra show that all the velocity dispersions obtained from integrated light measurements over small central areas suffer from large statistical errors due to the small numbers of bright stars present in the integration area. These simulations, over our area of integration of 6 sec x 6 sec, give sigmap = 15(+6/-4) km/s as the most probable values for the central velocity dispersion and its statistical error. The observational result differs from the challenging high central velocity dispersion sigmap of 0 = 25 km/s derived by Peterson, Seitzer, & Cudworth (1989) are consistent with ours. In a similar way, all the above velocity dispersion values obtained from integrated light measurements are consistent with the velocity dispersion sigmap = 14.2 +/- 1.9 km/s obtained by Peterson et al. (1989) from the radial velocities of 27 stars within 20 sec of the center. Given the large statistical errors on the integrated light measurements, there is no significant observational evidence that the central value of the velocity dispersion is much larger than about 15 km/s. All observed values are consistent with the predictions from various theoretical dynamical models of M15: sigmap of 0 = 12-17 km/s from Illingworth & King (1977), sigma p of 0 = 13-15 km/s from Phinney & Sigurdsson (1991) and Phinney (1993), and sigmap of 0 = 14 km/s from Grabhorn et al.

The present day best observations have an accuracy between several kilometers to few tens of kilometers, which is just the order of magnitude of the Lense-Thirring shifts of the orbits of the Galilean satellites over almost a century. From a comparison between analytical development and numerical integration it turns out that, unfortunately, most of the secular component of the gravitomagnetic signature is removed in the process of fitting the initial conditions. Indeed, an estimation of the magnitude of the Lense-Thirring effect in the ephemerides residuals is given; the resulting residuals have a maximum magnitude of 20 meters only (over 125 years).",

This force, according to Galileo Galilei, produced a misalignment of the satellites' rotation axis and their orbital planes, which he called \"thirty-years' tilt\". In the absence of a direct measurement of the effect, the tilt-angle has been deduced indirectly. However, observations of the dynamics of the Galilean satellites in the last years suggest that the gravity field is slightly asymmetric and the tilt angle about 15-20 arcseconds for Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. We offer a method to measure any tilt angle from a single observation of the Io's shadow and discuss its applicability to the Jovian system. The reduction of such an observation requires only a telescope with an angular resolution of 1/10 arcsecond in order to monitor the Io shadow. For the Galilean satellites, the angular resolution of the reduction procedure is about 3 arcseconds (1.5 arcseconds for Ganymede and Europa, 1.7 arcseconds for Callisto). The influence of the reduction procedure on the observational results is discussed. Since a tilt angle measure could affect the result of the observational study, a tilt angle of 20 arcseconds is adopted here. "

    "title": "Development of a Finite State Machine for the Automated Operation of the LLRF Control at FLASH.",
    "real_abstract": "The entry of digital signal processors in modern control systems not only allows for extended diagnostics compared to analog systems but also for sophisticated and tricky extensions of the control algorithms. With modern DSP- and FPGA-technology, the processing speed of digital systems is no longer inferior to analog systems in many applications. A higher degree of digitalization leads to an increased complexity of the systems and hence to higher requirements on their operators. The focus of research and development in the field of high frequency control has changed in the last few years and moved towards the direction of software development and complexity management. In the presented thesis, a frame for an automation concept of modern high frequency control systems is developed. The developed automation is based on the concept of finite state machines (FSM), which is established in industry for years. A flexible framework was developed, in which procedures communicate using standardized interfaces and can be exchanged easily. With that, the developer of high frequency control components as well as the operator on shift shall be empowered to improve and adapt the automation to changed conditions without special programming skills required. Along the automation concept a number of algorithms addressing various problems were developed which satisfy the needs of modern high frequency control systems. Among the developed and successfully tested algorithms are the calibration of incident and reflected wave of resonators without antennas, the fast adaptive compensation of repetitive errors, the robust estimation of the phase advance in the control loop and the latency adjustment for the rejection of instabilities caused by passband modes. During the development of the resonator theory, high value was set on the usability of the equation in algorithms for high frequency control. The usage of the common nomenclature of control theory emphasizes the underlying mathematical structures of the equations. Several physical limitations and requirements, for example the limits of the vector sum calibration, were newly and adequately calculated based on the developed theory. The linear accelerator of the Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) served as the main platform for testing of the algorithms and concepts. The developed automation, in particular the flexible and transparent framework and methods for the reduction of the complexity of the various communication channels (quantization) is not only suited for high fequency control but also for other aspects of an accelerator and beyond.",

When R is fixed at the global minimum value of 0.243, the widths of the eta' and eta'^ resonances are found to vary with the isospin angular momentum, and the correlations of their decay rates with the isospin is measured. For R=0.243, the width of the eta' resonance is found to vary from 2.6 to 2.9 fb, while the corresponding eta'^ width varies from 2.2 to 2.3 fb. The widths of the eta' and eta'^ resonances for R=0.3 are found to be of comparable magnitude and correlation with isospin. The width of the eta'^ resonance changes from 2.6 to 2.6 fb as R increases from 0.243 to 0.3, and the correlation with isospin is found to be in the same range."

Next, we provide stationary points of the spins-photon Hamiltonian when the spin particles belong to an orthogonal plane to the constant magnetic field.

We show that the gravitational duality principle is violated for the construction of the compact gravity dual to the teleparallel space-time by using some of the most general contortion detection arguments.

Microscopic description of phase transitions is notoriously difficult because of the absence of small parameters. Here we present a general approach allowing to treat situations, when there are no small parameters. The approach is based on optimized perturbation theory and self-similar approximation theory. It allows, starting with divergent perturbation series in powers of an asymptotically small parameter, to construct expressions extrapolating asymptotic series to arbitrary values of the parameter, including its infinite limit. Examples of such approximants are: right root approximants, left root approximants, continued root approximants, exponential approximants, and factor approximants. The approach is illustrated by the phase transition of gauge symmetry breaking in a multicomponent field theory. The found critical indices are in very good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations as well as with complicated methods of Pade-Borel summation, while our approach is much simpler. The nice feature of the approach is that it gives exact values for the cases where exact solutions are known.",

    "real_abstract": "Super star clusters are young, compact star clusters found in the central regions of interacting galaxies. Recently, they have also been reported to preferentially form in certain tidal tails, but not in others. In this paper, we have used 21 cm HI maps and the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images of eight tidal tail regions of four merging galaxy pairs to compare the kiloparsec scale HI distribution with the location of super star clusters found from the optical images. For most of the tails, we find that there is an increase in super star cluster density with increasing projected HI column density, such that the star cluster density is highest when log N(HI) >= 20.6 cm^{-2}, but equal to the background count rate at lower HI column density. However, for two tails (NGC 4038/39 Pos A and NGC 3921), there is no significant star cluster population despite the presence of gas at high column density. This implies that the N(HI) threshold is a necessary but not sufficient condition for cluster formation. Gas volume density is likely to provide a more direct criterion for cluster formation, and other factors such as gas pressure or strength of encounter may also have an influence. Comparison of HI thresholds needed for formation of different types of stellar structures await higher resolution HI and optical observations of larger numbers of interacting galaxies.",

In this context, we consider the development of star clusters in tidal debris. The size of the debris stream, given by the rate of mass leaving a cluster core, controls the time scale on which star formation occurs. For the case of a tidal stream of constant mass, the time scale depends on the HI mass of the stream, which in turn depends on the density contrast between the cluster core and the tidal stream, which in turn depends on the HI mass of the globular cluster core. We explore these relationships for a wide range and mass range of globular clusters, assessing the critical HI mass which triggers the onset of star formation. We find that the global behaviour of the mass of HI ~ 100 M_B^-_^, lying between the core and the orbit radius of the tidal stream, is likely to be the critical HI mass and that, in the lowest mass range, HI ~ 100 M_B^-_^ is probably the critical HI mass in all globular clusters. For the highest mass range, including the Sun and the observed core masses of globular clusters, this critical HI mass is significantly lower, ~ 70 M_B^-_^. We also find that, for globular clusters with core masses M_C~~10^11 M_sun_ for low mass and M_C~~1^11 M_sun_ for high mass, threshold HI masses change systematically with cluster mass. "

We compare the model to the limited dilepton data that are presently available and also integrate over one of the leptons to study the contributions to the single-lepton yield. We find that the high-mass vector mesons which are the hallmark of the generalized vector-dominance model make little contribution to the large yield of leptons observed in the transverse-momentum range 1<p⊥<6 GeV. We illustrate with a simple model, however, the extreme sensitivity of the large-p⊥ lepton yield to the large-transverse-momentum tail of vector-meson production.",

The CIII 977 and NIII 991 emission lines in this spectrum can be fitted with a narrow component of FWHM ~1000 kms-1 and a broad one of ~2500 kms-1. Another set of seven spatially resolved spectra were made using a long slit of 1.25' X 20', at steps of ~1' along the axis of the emission-line cone.

The observed spectra of the high latitude nuclear regions are consistent with models in which a disk forms a nuclear ring, with the disk itself being optically thin and the nuclear disk being optically thick. These data and previous observations of the galactic nucleus indicate that the nuclear ring is formed during the onset of massive star formation.

The central concentration is well populated by stars younger than 10 Gyr, but the outer region is dominated by stars belonging to the later spectral types (M and later). The age gradient across the cluster shows that the inner region is composed of young stars, whereas the outer region includes older stars.

In contrast, the inner region has been not affected by tidal interactions with the satellites of M55. Hence, the principal component of the stellar population of the globular cluster is indistinguishable from the age distribution of M55 as a whole. The stellar population of the cluster is transformed in the inner region by the effect of stellar AM CVn, which is present but much weaker than one would expect for a cluster older than 10 Gyr.

This can be done by influencing the public debate as well as participating in the process of reaching agreement on nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament.

    "real_abstract": "We show that the seesaw mechanism as well as leptogenesis are natural outcomes of a viable chaotic inflation in supergravity. The inflation model contains two superfields, the inflaton and stabilizer fields, which, being singlets under the standard model gauge symmetry, naturally couple to the lepton and Higgs doublets. The inflaton decays into leptons and Higgs fields, and the reheating temperature is predicted to be of O(1013) GeV , for which thermal leptogenesis is possible. On the other hand, gravitinos are copiously produced, and various solutions to the gravitino problem are discussed. We also argue that, if the shift symmetry of the inflaton is explicitly broken down to a discrete one, neutrino Yukawa couplings are periodic in the inflaton field, and masses of leptons and Higgs do not blow up even if the inflaton takes super-Planckian field values. The inflaton potential is given by a sum of sinusoidal functions with different height and periodicity, the so-called multi-natural inflation. We show that the predicted scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio lie in the region favored by the Planck data.",

The SDSS data show a strong signal for such an asymmetry with a probability <0.2%. The asymmetry axis is at (RA,dec) ~(202 deg,25 deg) with an uncertainty ~15 deg. The axis appears to be correlated with that of the quadrupole and octopole moments in the WMAP microwave sky survey, an unlikely alignment that has been dubbed 'the axis of evil'. Our Galaxy is aligned with its spin axis along the same direction as the majority of the spirals.",

Our survey of galaxies with a wide range of morphological types (up to Virgo-type) shows that the preferred arm direction is associated with a tendency for the spiral arm directions to be more equatorial than the bar in galaxies with a bar-density profile similar to that of spiral galaxies. This preferred arm orientation is best seen in the Magellanic Clouds. Our results are the first observational evidence for a galactic handedness in spiral galaxies. "

This oscillating shell can tunnel to a collapsing shell or a bouncing shell, where both tunnelings induce an event horizon and a singularity. In the entire path integral, via the oscillating solution, there is a nonzero probability to maintain a trivial causal structure without a singularity. Therefore, due to the path integral, the entire wave function can conserve information. Since an oscillating shell can tunnel after a number of oscillations, in the end, it will allow an infinite number of different branchings to classical histories. This system can be a good model of the effective loss of information, where information is conserved by a solution that is originated from gauge fields.",
    "fake_abstract": " The dynamics of magnetic shells inside the rotating neutron star is investigated here. We suggest that the spins of the inner sites are coupled, despite the weak coupling between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. This is supported by the sharply peaked profile of the full width at half maximum of the spin-down curve for different values of the magnetic field. The coupling between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field is computed and it turns out that the magnetic moment is magnetized even if the magnetic field is zero. Moreover, magnetic flux is generated by the magnetic moment, even if it is zero. This leads to the information loss problem, i.e., the configuration of a neutron star is expected to be specified by the initial magnetic field and the magnetic moment. However, the total energy and the total configuration of the neutron star cannot be retrieved from the initial magnetic field and the magnetic moment alone. "

The photon distribution depends on the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient, in contrast to the distribution obtained by methods based on entropy maximization. The calculated mean absorption coefficients are not only correct in the limit of optically thick and thin media, but even provide a reasonable interpolation in the cross-over regime between these limits, notably without introducing any fit parameter. The method is illustrated and discussed for grey matter and for a simple example of non-grey matter with a two-band absorption spectrum.

Both excesses may indicate towards decaying or annihilating dark matter with a mass of around 1–10 TeV . In this article we study the gamma rays from dark matter and constraints from cross correlations with distribution of galaxies, particularly in a local volume. We find that gamma rays due to inverse-Compton process have large intensity, and hence they give stringent constraints on dark matter scenarios in the TeV scale mass regime. Taking the recent developments in modeling astrophysical gamma-ray sources as well as comprehensive possibilities of the final state products of dark matter decay or annihilation into account, we show that the parameter regions of decaying dark matter that are suggested to explain the excesses are excluded. We also discuss the constrains on annihilating scenarios.",

In the cold phase, we suppose that the cold dark matter can freeze out of the gas due to thermalization process or the interaction with the hot baryons. The latter model is similar to the cosmological freeze out scenario. In both phases, the cold dark matter goes to thermal equilibrium with the gas, and the cold dark matter density goes to zero within a limited dynamical time. In the gas phase, we study the instabilities in the baryonic-gas halo which are induced by the dark matter dynamics. In the cold phase, we analyze the influence between the dark matter dynamics and the dark matter freeze out on the local galaxy properties. We find that the presence of dark matter freeze out can help to constrain the particle dark matter at this scale changing the constraints on the model parameters in a current CDM model."

Our dataset spans a long timeline of ~14 years with 974-3027 flux measurements per source. We find strong (factors ~2-8) flux variability on timescales of years for all sources. The flux density distributions of five out of six sources show clear signatures of bi- or even multimodality. Our sources show mostly steep (alpha~0.5-1), variable spectral indices that indicate outflow dominated emission; the variability is most probably due to optical depth variations. The power spectra globally correspond to red-noise spectra with five sources being located between the cases of white and flicker noise and one source (3C 111) being closer to the case of random walk noise. For three sources the low-frequency ends of their power spectra appear to be upscaled in spectral power by factors ~2-3 with respect to the overall powerlaws. In two sources, 3C 454.3 and 3C 84, the 1.3-mm emission preceeds the 3-mm emission by ~55 and ~300 days, respectively, probably due to (combinations of) optical depth and emission region geometry effects.

The Magellanic Clouds are a rich reservoir of PNe and earlier stages of stellar evolution. We derive the ages of PNe in the Magellanic Clouds and follow the stellar evolution of the PNe in order to determine constraints on the post-AGB evolution. We find that the populations of PNe and the stellar luminosity function are very similar in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), but that the LMC PNe are significantly more massive than the Magellanic Clouds PNe. Thus, the post-AGB evolution of the LMC is more evolved than that of the Magellanic Clouds, which is in agreement with the predictions of the integrated picture of AGB evolution and with the results from the stars and AGB stars. We also show that the large population of PNe in the Magellanic Clouds is probably the result of the dynamical fragmentation of the gas in the tidal injection process, and that the dynamical fragmentation of the gas is probably triggered by the interaction with the large reservoir of LMC comets.

The LBG host galaxies appear to be overdense regions with masses \\sim 1.5\\times10^{-9}$M_\\odot, while the overall stellar population of these galaxies is \\sim 7\\times10^{-8} M_\\odot, making them the most massive galaxies known in the early universe.

The correspondence principle, which implies that the relevant quantum theories are the same in curved space-time and flat space-time, is one of the cornerstones of our understanding of quantum field theory. As an application of the correspondence principle, we show that a generalization of the holographic bound to quantum field theories can be obtained by replacing the CPT theorem by the correspondence principle in the holographic formalism."

    "fake_abstract": " Over the last two decades strong experimental evidence has been accumulated for the universality of the Standard Model, which describes elementary particles and their interactions. A comprehensive test of this model is its ability to fit the observations of high-energy cosmic rays and of neutrinos. In addition the Standard Model predicts the existence of three families of fundamental particles: leptons, quarks and the gluons that bind them. At the same time it explains all experimental data, including those of the weak interaction, which governs all particle interactions. The Standard Model has been tested by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, using two accelerator rings, one of electrons and the other of protons. However, the last two years have brought new results that indicate that the Standard Model may be incomplete. This situation has motivated a major effort in the international scientific community, to construct a new, but fully independent model called TeraHEP, that extends the Standard Model to higher-energy particles, such as muons, taus and neutrinos, many of which show deviations from the predictions of the Standard Model. TeraHEP is a purely theoretical project. At the same time we have to consider practical issues: the energy, the materials, the detector, the detector time, the future upgrade of the LHC and the acceleration of the Higgs particle. The highest energy particle collider will require a huge investment. At the border between proton and electron energies, an energy of $10^{34}$ electron volts, the accelerators will require an investment of more than $10^{12}$ billion euros. The TeraHEP project includes several initiatives."

    "title": "Observational evidence for high neutronization in supernova remnants: implications for Type Ia supernova progenitors.",
    "real_abstract": "The physical process whereby a carbon–oxygen white dwarf explodes as a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remains highly uncertain. The degree of neutronization in SN Ia ejecta holds clues to this process because it depends on the mass and the metallicity of the stellar progenitor, and on the thermodynamic history prior to the explosion. We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization using Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs). Applying this method to Suzaku data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397, and G337.2−0.7 in the Milky Way, and N103B in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we find that the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho and Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source of neutronization in SNe Ia. We then use a grid of SN Ia explosion models to infer the metallicities of the stellar progenitors of our SNRs. The implied metallicities of 3C 397, G337.2−0.7, and N103B are major outliers compared to the local stellar metallicity distribution functions, indicating that progenitor metallicity can be ruled out as the origin of neutronization for these SNRs. Although the relationship between ejecta neutronization and equivalent progenitor metallicity is subject to uncertainties stemming from the (12)C + (16)O reaction rate, which affects the Ca/S mass ratio, our main results are not sensitive to these details.",
    "fake_abstract": " We use the observational evidence for high neutronization in supernova remnants from Baade's window to probe the evolution of the supernova explosion. Using the supernovae known to have remnants in Baade's window and extrapolating to the Galactic halo, we find that a typical evolutionary model for a Type Ia progenitor which undergoes a \"missing transonic phase\" before explosion (and which is not consistent with explosion models) predicts a large number of remnant candidates in Baade's window. We find that, empirically, the observed number of remnants is in good agreement with explosion models that predict a strong neutronization of the core phase, if the missing transonic phase is absent. If the missing phase is present, these models predict only a fraction of the number of remnant candidates seen. In this scenario, a missing phase does not avoid the explosion, but instead delays the absorption of the blastwave in the expanded cold, dense shock wave which forms in the core of the remnant. In this scenario, the blastwave continues to be delayed for ~10 Myr, resulting in a strong neutronization of the core, as observed in Baade's window. We show that, in an explosion scenario with an accelerated precursor, the observed number of remnants in Baade's window is in good agreement with the explosion models. In the absence of a cold, dense shock wave, however, explosion models that predict only a small number of remnants seem to be more consistent with the observational data. "

We detected two T-37 associations in this galaxy, at 21.4 and 43.2 Mpc, including the previously known association at ~35 Mpc. Our results confirm the presence of two well-separated, smaller T-37 associations in IC1396, but which are not disrupted in the central regions. We find no evidence for a merger/kick event at the origin of the larger association, and also suggest that the smaller one (21.4 Mpc) may be associated with MUF 71, at ~34 Mpc, which is consistent with a previous X-ray study. The lack of a tight connection between the H\\alpha emission, the X-ray luminosity, the stellar mass of a galaxy, and its luminosity function, is explained by a lack of feedback-driven star formation, leading to a smooth and evolving stellar mass function.

The use of X_m_a_x in the determination of the primary particle mass can only be done by comparing the measured values with simulation predictions. For this reason it is important to study the differences between the available simulation models. We have done a study of the first and second moments of the X_m_a_x distribution using the Corsika and Conex programs. The study was done with high statistics in the energy range from 10^1^7 to 10^2^0^.^4eV. We focus our analysis in the different implementations of the hadronic interaction models Sibyll2.1 and QGSJetII in Corsika and Conex. We show that the predictions of the <X_m_a_x> and RMS(X_m_a_x) depend slightly on the combination of simulation program and hadronic interaction model. Although these differences are small, they are not negligible in some cases (up to 5g/cm^2 for the worse case) and they should be considered as a systematic uncertainty of the model predictions for <X_m_a_x> and RMS(X_m_a_x). We have included a table with the suggested systematic uncertainties for the model predictions. Finally, we present a parametrization of the X_m_a_x distribution as a function of mass and energy according to the models Sibyll2.1 and QGSJetII, and showed an example of its application to obtain the predicted X_m_a_x distributions from cosmic ray propagation models.",

The moments of the Xmax distribution were found to be superimposed on the moments of the shower from the forward rapid growth case. The moments of the Xmax distribution were found to be in a slightly different order for the two cases, which can be taken as evidence of the different theoretical origins of the two models. "

We show that the correlation strength of $\\lya$ clouds is somewhat weaker than that of the underlying matter, which in turn is weaker than that of galaxies (biased galaxy formation). On the scales probed, $10-300$km/s, for $\\lya$ clouds, we find that higher density, higher optical depth, higher column density regions are more strongly clustered than lower density, lower optical depth, lower column density regions. Thus, a consistent picture seems to emerge: the correlation strength for a given set of objects is positively correlated with their characteristic global density and the differences among the correlations of galaxies, $\\lya$ clouds and mass reflect the differences in density that each trace. Significant positive correlations with a strength of $0.1-1.0$ are found for $\\lya$ clouds in the velocity range $50-300$km/s. Among the correlational measures examined, an optical depth correlation function (Equation 5) proposed here may serve as the best correlational measure. It reasonably faithfully represents the true correlation of the underlying matter, enabling a better indication of both matter correlation and the relationship between galaxies and $\\lya$ clouds. Furthermore, it appears to be an alternative to the conventional line-line correlation function with the virtue that it does not require ambiguous post-observation fitting procedures such as those commonly employed in the conventional line-finding methods. Neither does it depend sensitively on the observational resolution (e.g., FWHM), insofaras the clouds are resolved Conveniently, it can be easily measured with the current observational sensitivity without being contaminated significantly by the presence of noise.",
    "fake_abstract": " Observations of Lyman-alpha clouds (LACs) have shown that they tend to form in dense regions of the galaxy, primarily in the central 10-20 kpc. As the clouds drift in the galaxy, they will respond to any perturbation in the density field. We have used such an effect to model the structure of simulated LACs, using the same prescription for the density field as for the clouds. The clouds respond to the density field in two ways: by attracting the very dense gas at the core, and by releasing the gas from regions which are now less dense. We find that simulated LACs do indeed display a core, and that the core is usually found in the central 10-20 kpc, with a few clouds drifting above or below the core. When the clouds are above the core, we find that the clouds can move in any direction with respect to the core, but when the clouds are below the core, then the clouds can only move up or down. We explore the effect of field tilt, to determine whether it tends to orient the clouds along the tilt (as is the case in real LACs), or whether it may produce a mixed response. We find that the clouds mostly migrate sideways, with a few clouds being oriented along-tilt. Almost all of the clouds can migrate in any direction, the only difference being the amount of tilt that appears in the clouds. We suggest that models which require clouds to be oriented along-tilt need to be tested to determine whether the clouds are indeed oriented along-tilt. We also suggest that the small number of clouds observed to migrate up-tilt may be an artifact of the simulations, as either an artifact of the density field simulation, or that clouds up-tilt may not exist at all.

The VLAC is a detector that has been used for many years in cosmic-ray, subatomic particle and accelerator experiments, but only in a few experiments (e.g. LLL, MSSL, IP, etc.) at the LHC. The large vane is a high resolution detector, and the fast reconstruction of a large number of events (at least 1 million) is crucial to build a complete picture of the hadron spectrum. The VLAC is therefore a key component of the CP in all LHC phases. This paper describes the physics and engineering aspects of the development of the VLAC for the LHC. "

We here present a spectroscopic study of the exceptionally bright (10^6 - 10^8 Lsun) but compact (Re ~ 5 pc) nuclear star clusters in very late type spirals with UVES at the VLT. We find the velocity dispersions of the nine clusters in our sample to range from 13 to 34 km/s. Using photometric data from the HST/WFPC2 and spherically symmetric dynamical models we determine masses between 8*10^5 and 6*10^7 Msun. The mass to light ratios range from 0.2 to 1.5 in the I band. This indicates a young mean age for most clusters, in agreement with previous studies. Given their high masses and small sizes we find that nuclear clusters are among the objects with the highest mean surface density known (up to 10^5 Msun pc^-2). From their dynamical properties we infer that, rather than small bulges, the closest structural kin of nuclear clusters appear to be massive compact star clusters. This includes such different objects as globular clusters, super star clusters, ultra compact dwarf galaxies and the nuclei of dwarf elliptical galaxies. It is a challenge to explain why, despite the wildly different current environments, all different types of massive star clusters share very similar and structural properties. A possible explanation links UCDs and massive globular clusters to nuclear star clusters through stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies in a merger event. The extreme properties of this type of clusters would then be a consequence of their location in the centers of their respective host galaxies.",

    "real_abstract": "We probe the physical conditions in high-redshift damped Ly-alpha systems using the observed molecular fraction and the rotational excitation of molecular hydrogen. We report two new detections of H2 at z = 2.402 and 1.989 toward, respectively, HE 0027-1836 and HE 2318-1107. We also present a detailed analysis of our recent H2 detection toward Q2343+125. All three systems have low molecular fractions, log f < -4, with f = 2N(H2)/(2N(H2) + N(HI)). Only one such H2 system was known previously. The depletion patterns for Si, S, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni in the three systems are found to be very similar to what is observed in diffuse gas of the Galactic halo. H2 absorption from rotational levels up to J = 5 is observed in a single component toward HE 0027-1836. We show that the width (Doppler parameter) of the H2 lines increases with increasing J and that the kinetic energy derived from the Doppler parameter is linearly dependent on the relative energy of the rotational levels. The excitation temperature is found to be 90 K for J = 0 to J = 2 and ~500 K for higher J levels. Single isothermal PDR models fail to reproduce the observed rotational excitations. A two-component model is needed: one component of low density (~50 cm-3) with weak illumination (chi = 1) to explain the J <= 2 rotational levels and another of high density (~500 cm-3) with strong illumination (chi = 30) for J >= 3 levels. However, the juxtaposition of these two PDR components may be ad-hoc and the multicomponent structure could result either from turbulent dissipation or C-shocks.",

We present UV, optical, and H2 emission line data for DLACs IRAS 1606-2414, 1618-2437, and 1613-2340, based on the deepest optical observations of the Universe. Three distinct emission signatures are found: (1) The typical Lyα emission with a peak at 1535.8 nm and a FWHM of ˜150 km/s; (2) the emission from the cool gas that is heated by UV photons; and (3) a Lyα \"tail\" with a FWHM of ∼3000 km/s and a different spectral shape at lower energies. These signatures are interpreted as evidence for the excitation of H2 Lyα by UV photons and excited gas, respectively. In all three clouds, we find that the ratio of the electron to Lyα emission lines varies systematically with excitation level, potentially explaining the origin of variations in the excitation of the Lyα lines observed in DLACs.

Additionally, it is not possible to take into account the spatial properties of the magnetic field and flow velocity, or the effects of diffusion and gradient and curvature drifts in these models. In this paper we present an extension to the current nebula models by including a spatial dependence in our numerical solutions of a Fokker-Planck particle transport equation.

Although applied within the context of pulsar wind nebulae, the presented solutions are equally valid for any similar central source system such as globular clusters.",

It is postulated that the energetic particle spectrum is generated in the pulsar wind envelope. The most notable features of the PWNs, such as the prominence of slow electrons, are dominated by the wind acceleration process. It is therefore not clear whether the accelerated particles originate in the plasma or in the wind. In general relativity, it is well-known that it is possible to have a relativistic plasma accelerate particles. However, such a scenario requires the acceleration of the accelerated particles to be faster than light, which is forbidden by relativity. We explore the possibility of accelerating charged particles in the PWNs, based on the requirement that the acceleration of particles in a relativistically accelerated plasma cannot exceed the speed of light. We show that a relativistically accelerated plasma can accelerate charged particles if the acceleration of the plasma is faster than the speed of light. The plasma acceleration must be caused by magnetic reconnection and is thus different from the wind acceleration. We show that the acceleration of charged particles can explain the angular distributions of the electrons in the PWNs and can also explain the prominence of slow electrons. The electron acceleration is proportional to the local field acceleration but can be larger than the wind acceleration. We show that the electron acceleration can produce the slow spin and the emission spectrum of the pulsar wind nebula as well as the magnetic field of the nucleus. "

We obtain the reduced density matrix for the light field, its time evolution is determined by an effective action that includes the influence action from correlations of the heavy degrees of freedom. The non-equilibrium effective field theory yields a Langevin equation of motion for the light field in terms of dissipative and noise kernels that obey a generalized fluctuation dissipation relation. These are completely determined by the spectral density of the bath which is analyzed in detail for several cases. At T = 0 we elucidate the effect of thresholds in the renormalization aspects and the asymptotic emergence of a local effective field theory with unitary time evolution. At $T\\ne 0$ new ‘anomalous’ thresholds arise, in particular the decay of the environmental heavy fields into the light field leads to dissipative dynamics of the light field. Even when the heavy bath particles are thermally suppressed this dissipative contribution leads to the thermalization of the light field which is confirmed by a quantum kinetics analysis. We obtain the quantum master equation and show explicitly that its solution in the field basis is precisely the influence action that determines the effective non-equilibrium field theory. The Lindblad form of the quantum master equation features time dependent dissipative coefficients. Their time dependence is crucial to extract renormalization effects at asymptotically long time. The dynamics from the quantum master equation is in complete agreement with that of the effective action, Langevin dynamics and quantum kinetics, thus providing a unified framework to effective field theory out of equilibrium.",

The resulting neutrino overdensity above the cosmic mean neutrino density increases with both the neutrino mass and the halo mass, ranging from about 10 for 0.3 eV neutrinos in 10^13 M_sun halos, to about 1500 for 1.8 eV neutrinos in 10^15 M_sun halos.

Thus they generalise a well known perturbation method to massive particles with spin 1/2 and anisotropic spacetime. They consider a few explicit examples for both isotropic and anisotropic expansion and discuss the relevance of the corresponding results for the early universe. These examples allow singularity avoidance and anisotropy damping to be modelled. Particle production effects become significant when the characteristic timescale of the expansion of the universe is comparable with the particle's Compton time. If the universe passes through a singularity the energy densities take their largest values but they remain finite and approach zero exponentially fast in the limit of large particle mass.

The experimental setup includes three different, ψ-symmetric calorimeters covering almost the complete solid angle. The detector system, together with a polarised target and a linearly or circularly polarised photon beam, allows in addition to the measurement of cross sections also the measurement of single- and double-polarisation observables. Baryon resonances up to masses of 2.5 GeV can be investigated.In the course of a major upgrade of the CsI(Tl) calorimeters, two different techniques to detect the light generated in the crystals are compared with the known performance of the existing photodiode readout. The aim of the new techniques is to enable the calorimeter to be a first level trigger source while keeping a very good energy resolution comparable to the present pho-todiode readout.The first solution is a complete redesign of the crystal readout, featuring two 10mm x 10mm APDs mounted directly on the crystals. With an integrated, fast preamplifier, this readout will allow both an energy measurement and the generation of a fast timing-/trigger-signal. The second solution is a modification of the existing setup. The photodiode will continue to provide the energy information while two additional SiPMs will create the timing-/trigger-signal.",

The agreement is particularly striking for the first-order differential conversion process, which accounts for more than 95% of the total energy deposited by Tl in the calorimeters. "

    "real_abstract": "We use a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of a halo, coupled to semi-analytic techniques, to study the formation of our own Galaxy and of its stellar halo. Our model Milky Way galaxy is a relatively young system whose physical properties are in quite good agreement with observational determinations. In our model, the stellar halo is mainly formed from a few massive satellites accreted early on during the galaxy's lifetime. The stars in the halo do not exhibit any metallicity gradient, but higher metallicity stars are more centrally concentrated than stars with lower abundances. This is due to the fact that the most massive satellites contributing to the stellar halo are also more metal rich, and dynamical friction drags them closer to the inner regions of the host halo.",
    "fake_abstract": " Since the very early universe, the structure of the Universe was subjected to a continuous process of mergers, grow and fragmentation through the merging processes. We consider galaxy formation and evolution in the context of a hybrid cosmology combining the data from both local low redshift observations and high redshift observations from the distant Universe. In this scenario, a new paradigm is suggested by which a halo is formed when a galaxy is merged with its satellite. The stars in the satellite move in the opposite direction of the satellite motion and acquire an orbital velocity, which is larger than the local velocities of the stars, thus leading to a contraction of the satellite. We show that the galaxies in a cosmological framework are formed by merging of a satellite galaxy with a halo, and that this process also leads to a contraction of the satellite. Finally, we explore the implications of the hybrid cosmology for the determination of the dark matter distribution and the mass budget of the Milky Way. Our results show that the satellite of the Milky Way can be significantly smaller than the Milky Way, and that this scenario agrees with the scenario of a light-weight halo. "

The results of self-consistent beam-beam simulation, the linearized Vlasov equation, and the rigid-beam model were compared with the experimental measurement. It was found that the coherent beam-beam tune shifts measured in the experiment and calculated in the simulation agree remarkably well but they are much smaller than those calculated by the linearized Vlasov equation with the single-mode approximation or the rigid-beam model.

    "title": "The uv-optical albedo of broad emission line clouds.",
    "real_abstract": "We explore the effective UV-optical albedos of a variety of types of broad emission line clouds, as well as their possible effects on the observed spectra of AGN. An important albedo source in moderately ionized ionization-bounded clouds is that due to neutral hydrogen: Rayleigh scattering of continuum photons off the extreme damping wings of Lya. The photons resulting from this scattering mechanism may contribute significantly to the Lya emission line, especially in the very broad wings. In addition, line photons emitted near 1200 Angstroms (e.g., N V 1240) that stream toward the neutral portion of the cloud may be reflected off this Rayleigh scattering mirror, so that they preferentially escape from the illuminated face. Inclusion of this effect can alter predicted emission line strengths and profiles. In more highly-ionized ionization-bounded clouds, Thompson scattering dominates the UV-optical albedo, but this albedo is lessened by the hydrogen gas opacity. These clouds are most reflective on the long wavelength side of the hydrogen recombination edges: this feature may then alter the shapes of the spectral regions near the recombination edges. We illustrate the effects of gas density and line broadening on the effective albedo. We also discuss the reflection effects of the accretion disk and the ``dusty torus.'' The accretion disk is an effective reflector of UV-optical photons, whether by electron or Rayleigh scattering, and it is possible that we observe a significant fraction of this light from the AGN in reflection. This effect can alter the emission line profiles and even destroy emission at the Lyman jump emitted by broad line clouds. Finally, we discuss the possibility that continuum reflection from broad line clouds is at least in part responsible for the polarized broad absorption line troughs.",
    "fake_abstract": " We have investigated the optical albedo of broad emission line clouds (BECs) in the lab and with the GALEX space telescope. Using the computed physical parameters of BECs, we find that the optical width of BECs appears to be reduced by factors of two to three when compared to typical star-forming regions (SFRs). This reduction is found to be due to the enhancement of the scattering efficiency of the outer parts of the BEC. Thus, the optical albedo of BECs is strongly enhanced in the outer regions. The optical albedo of BECs can be explained by assuming the presence of clumps or islands of dust grains orbiting the central region of the BEC. The gravitational self-attraction of the dust clumps leads to a cloud-to-cloud scattering enhancement, while the scattering of the dust particles by the cold gas at the inner parts of the BEC is reduced by a factor of two to three. These results are related to the optical intensity profile of the optically-thin BEC emission. "

The reasons for this are many, but one of the most important is that transiting exoplanets are difficult to detect: the transit method is a very delicate one, which requires the detection of minute dips in the host star’s light across the transit. Mercury and Venus transits of the Sun have been observed over the last century, but finding a planet that has transited a distant star is a very difficult task. While there are a few dedicated transit searches, most are devoted to other kinds of exoplanet detection, such as Doppler shifts.

In this letter, we report a new mass for 11Li using the TITAN trapping experiment at TRIUMF's ISAC facility where `designer atomic nuclei' can be produced and studied in detail. This is by far the shortest-lived nuclide, t1/2 = 8.8 ms, for which a mass measurement has ever been performed with a Penning trap.

Moreover, if the soft-breaking term is assumed to be very small, then the vacuum oscillations of nu_e have almost maximal amplitude and solve the solar-neutrino problem.

We calculate, with the help of an effective field theory approach, the three neutrino masses and the mixing angle of all three neutrinos with respect to the lightest neutrino. The values of the mixing angles are all of the same order of magnitude and exhibit a periodic behavior, which is characteristic of oscillations.

This age distribution is compared with the distribution of the present-day open clusters in the Galaxy, as determined by radial mixing models, and is found to be in agreement with that obtained by the present-day globular-cluster method, thus justifying the use of globular-cluster ages as a standard reference. The age distribution of the present-day open clusters is found to be more peaked than that of the young clusters, while the distribution of the age of the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds is found to be flat. The cluster-age relation for the Magellanic Clouds is found to differ from the relation for the present-day Galaxy. The present work allows us to determine both the age and mass function of the young open clusters in the Galaxy, and therefore to guide our investigation of the cluster-mass relation, which is needed to solve the problem of the formation of the present-day open clusters by dynamical processes. We detect a peak in the mass function at about 1.6 solar masses and a steep slope in the mass function (the so-called \"age-mass relation\") at ages up to 0.6 Gyr, but no trend arising from dynamical processes.

However, cosmological inference based on SZE cluster surveys is limited by our incomplete knowledge of scatter, and evolution in the Y–M relation. In this work, we investigate the effects of galaxy cluster mergers on the scaling relation using the Omega500 high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We show that the non-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced gas motions contributes significantly to the scatter, and evolution of the scaling relation. After the merger, the kinetic energy of merging systems is slowly converted into thermal energy through dissipation of turbulent gas motions, which causes the thermal SZE signal to increase steadily with time. This post-merger evolution is one of the primary source of scatter in the Y–M relation. However, we show that when the missing non-thermal energy is accounted for, the resulting relation exhibits little to no redshift evolution and the scatter around the scaling relation is ∼20%–30% smaller than that of the thermal SZE signal alone. Our work opens up a possibility to further improve the current robust mass proxy, Y, by accounting for the missing non-thermal pressure component.

    "fake_abstract": " We present X-ray observations of the cluster of galaxies Pisces X-1 obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Observation of this cluster shows that Chandra can detect cluster galaxies at z~1. The z=1.4 cluster contains about 92 galaxies, which are all detected in optical, ultraviolet and infrared colors; these galaxies show no evidence for starbursts. The Fe XII emission is detected as a broad double line feature at a spectral resolution of ~250 km s-1. This is the first high-resolution X-ray emission from a cluster of galaxies. The FUV emission arises from the hot gas of the cluster and is enhanced in the cluster core and at the edges. The X-ray emission arises mostly from the hot gas in the center of the cluster, but a small fraction is associated with the cold gas outside the hot core. The line and continuum emission are not correlated in terms of their redshifts and velocities. The line emission is strongly correlated with the X-ray emission with a correlation coefficient of about -0.5, which implies a dynamical connection between the hot core and the cold gas. This is the first detection of an X-ray emission from a cluster of galaxies, suggesting that X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies is not unique to galaxy collisions, as previously thought. "

This model is based on the results of particle-cyclotron and ultra-fast electron drift measurements in the magnetosheath, as well as on a detailed study of electron-particle and electron-cyclotron scattering components. With this model Cassiopeia A plasma is described adequately only for the altitude reached at the current epoch. (2) The particle-cyclotron angle shows a four times larger dependence on the plasma sheath density than the quasi-instantaneous angle. This result is explained in terms of a different acceleration mechanism in the plasma and magnetosheath, while in the magnetosheath the attractive acceleration is the dominant one. (3) A comparison of the results of the inclusive energies of particles accelerated in the plasma and magnetosheath with those of the experiment at the FBF as well as with simulations of the Cassiopeia experiment provides evidence for the dominance of the local acceleration in the plasma sheath. (4) The acceleration in the magnetosheath is enhanced by the heat dissipation of the plasma sheath. The heat-dissipation transfer is explained by the existence of a strong electric field in the magnetosheath upstream of the acceleration region. The electric field strength depends on the mass and charge of the particle, and its location in the plasma sheath."

Accordingly, although the perturbation series available is up to g 3 order, we found a complete agreement between our resummed effective potential and the well known features from constructive field theory. We prove that the 1-PI correlation functions and the effective potential ought to have the same large order as well as strong coupling behaviors.

As the properties of the multiphase warm absorber (thoroughly discussed in a recent, complementary work) hint at a steep photoionizing continuum, here we investigate into the nature of the intrinsic X-ray emission of MR 2251−178 by testing several physical models. The apparent 2–10 keV flatness as well as the subtle broad-band curvature can be ascribed to partial covering of the X-ray source by a cold, clumpy absorption system with column densities ranging from a fraction to several ×10^23 cm^−2. As opposed to more complex configurations, only one cloud is required along the line of sight in the presence of a soft X-ray excess, possibly arising as Comptonized disc emission in the accretion disc atmosphere. On statistical grounds, even reflection with standard efficiency off the surface of the inner disc cannot be ruled out, although this tentatively overpredicts the observed ∼14–150 keV emission. It is thus possible that each of the examined physical processes is relevant to a certain degree, and hence, only a combination of high-quality, simultaneous broad-band spectral coverage and multi-epoch monitoring of X-ray spectral variability could help disentangling the different contributions. Yet, regardless of the model adopted, we infer for MR 2251−178 a bolometric luminosity of ∼5–7 × 10^45 erg s^−1, implying that the central black hole is accreting at ∼15–25 per cent of the Eddington limit.",

The spectrum at 1.01 keV reveals the presence of absorption by Fe I and Fe II, which may indicate a feature-rich plasma at the line core. The spectrum at 1.20 keV shows a strong Na I absorption feature, which is connected with the presence of a large-scale neutral gas in the line-emitting region.

    "real_abstract": "Magnetically driven astrophysical jets are related to accretion and involve toroidal magnetic field pressure inflating poloidal magnetic field flux surfaces. Examination of particle motion in combined gravitational and magnetic fields shows that these astrophysical jet toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields can be powered by the gravitational energy liberated by accreting dust grains that have become positively charged by emitting photo-electrons. Because a dust grain experiences magnetic forces after becoming charged, but not before, charging can cause irreversible trapping of the grain so dust accretion is a consequence of charging. Furthermore, charging causes canonical angular momentum to replace mechanical angular momentum as the relevant constant of the motion. The resulting effective potential has three distinct classes of accreting particles distinguished by canonical angular momentum, namely (i) 'cyclotron-orbit', (ii) 'Speiser-orbit', and (iii) 'zero canonical angular momentum' particles. Electrons and ions are of class (i) but depending on mass and initial orbit inclination, dust grains can be of any class. Light-weight dust grains develop class (i) orbits such that the grains are confined to nested poloidal flux surfaces, whereas grains with a critical weight such that they experience comparable gravitational and magnetic forces can develop class (ii) or class (iii) orbits, respectively producing poloidal and toroidal field dynamos.",
    "fake_abstract": " Relativistic flows of matter accelerated by accretion onto a magnetized black hole are a possible energy source for Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). Dust heated by the relativistic disk can trigger the production of gamma rays by the coronal emission-line system. The acceleration of the material leads to a strong magnetic field, which may have a significant effect on the coronal emission lines. The magnetic field of the relativistic disk can be translated by the black hole. In this scenario the acceleration of the dust can be powered by a magnetic field generated by the black hole through magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The magnetic field is generated by the twisted and swirling motion of the viscous magnetic field lines in the accretion flow. The magnetic field can be transferred to the dust by radiation pressure, thus driving the acceleration of the particle. We show that this mechanism can produce a broad-band optical afterglow of the GRB at redshift z=2.5, as well as a narrow-band optical/UV afterglow at z=1.5 from a GRB at low inclination. We use a simple estimate of the acceleration power, given by the Lorentz factor of the magnetic field, to demonstrate that the magnetic field can power the acceleration process. "

We find that LNNNT can have a sensitivity to the burst type L x-ray burst with a 5% probability or less. The LNNT can detect a total of 34 GRBs with a median detection depth of about 200 seconds, assigned about two-thirds of the bursts to type-L. The NSO and IceCube projects, which are sensitive to a wider energy range will extend the LNNT sample to 40 and 24, respectively. The sensitivity of LNNT to the burst depths L x-ray <100 seconds and L gamma <100s will determine the separation between the two events for type-L events. The maximum sensitivity of LNNNT to L gamma bursts will be limited by the sensitivity of the later detectors in the L-dumb array. We expect LNNT to discover at least 8 and 4 type-L events with a 1σ significance at an event rate of 2.5 and 2.3 per year, respectively.

We present numerical evidence that, as the volume increases, the Fisher's zeros of 4-dimensional pure gauge SU(2) lattice gauge theory with a Wilson action, stabilize at a distance larger than 0.15 from the real axis in the complex beta=4/g^2 plane. We discuss the implications for proofs of confinement and searches for nontrivial infra-red fixed points in models beyond the standard model.",
    "fake_abstract": " The theory of the renormalization group (RG) convergence of physical quantities is illustrated by considering the renormalization group flow of the zero temperature charge renormalization constant (ZTRC) in the complex plane. Using the well-known rescalings of the Euclidean space of renormalizable operators (ROS) which are induced by the physical parameters, the ZTRC is shown to converge precisely in the case of SU(3) f_p. This proves that the physical dimension of the complex plane is necessarily equal to the product of the physical dimensions of the real and imaginary parts. "

    "real_abstract": "Multiturn (or turn-by-turn) data acquisition has proven to be a new source of direct measurements for Twiss parameters in storage rings. On the other hand, closed-orbit measurements are a long-known tool for analyzing closed-orbit perturbations with conventional beam position monitor (BPM) systems and are necessarily available at every storage ring. This paper aims at combining the advantages of multiturn measurements and closed-orbit data. We show that only two multiturn BPMs and four correctors in one localized drift space in the storage ring (diagnostic drift) are sufficient for model-independent and absolute measuring of β and φ functions at all BPMs, including the conventional ones, instead of requiring all BPMs being equipped with multiturn electronics.",

The proposed method was checked for the functions of B0, B0*, 2B0, 2B0* and theta_0. The multitrot measurement of theta_0 and the lack of unambiguous determination of its second derivative were used for comparing the multiturn data with the closed-orbit measurements. The angular resolution of the multiturn method was found to be higher by a factor of 3.7 than that of the closed-orbit method. The multiturn data were used to estimate the uncertainty of theta_0. The multiturn method was considered to be a promising method for the determination of the optical functions in storage rings. "

The reaction products were separated from scattered beam and fission fragments by the gas-filled recoil separator RITU, and were implanted in the double-sided silicon strip detectors of the GREAT spectrometer. Prompt γ rays were detected by the JUROGAM Ge detector array and were assigned to Re161 based on α- and proton-decay tagging of the implanted reaction products. The near-yrast high-spin level structure, which was delineated to spins around 39/2, is discussed in the context of the total Routhian surface formalism. The level scheme is interpreted in terms of the alignment of h9/2/f7/2 neutrons at lower spins, followed by excitations involving the πh11/2 subshell at higher spins.",

This approach allows us to study the states with a very wide range of neutron energies and velocities, ranging from the very low-energy mostly-bound states to the high-energy mostly-free states. We show that the linear response of the ground-state spin wave is only partially represented by the excited states, by comparing the measured excitation energies and velocities with the excitation wavefunctions computed with our theory. The wavefunction of the excited states can vary from one excited-state wavefunction to another, depending on the neutron and target-nucleus combination, and the wavefunction of one excited-state wavefunction can overshoot to another excited state, depending on the neutron and target-nucleus combination and on previous excitations. The first excited state is the one for which the wavefunction is largest, and it is usually smaller than the second excited state. We show that the first excited state is mainly associated with the spin flip of the ground state. "

We investigate three kinds of widely used physical statistics, i.e., the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) distribution, the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution, and the Bose-Einstein (BE) distribution, and find that the BG and FD distributions both fluctuate slightly in a periodic manner around the Benford distribution with respect to the temperature of the system, while the BE distribution conforms to it exactly whatever the temperature is. Thus the Benford's law seems to present a general pattern for physical statistics and might be even more fundamental and profound in nature. Furthermore, various elegant properties of Benford's law, especially the mantissa distribution of data sets, are discussed.",

We show that the significant digit law holds for all real integrals, and that it is also true for all imaginary integrals, provided that the imaginary part of the integral is finite.

We also show that the significance digit of imaginary integrals is the same as their imaginary part divided by their real part. Thus, the significance digit depends only on the ratio of their imaginary part and real part. We further show that the significance digit of imaginary integrals depends only on their real part. Thus, the significance digit depends only on the ratio of their imaginary part and the real part. We explain the signs of the digits quantitatively, and show that they do not violate the basic rules of arithmetic. We also show that the number of digits does not depend on the quantity to which the sum is raised, and that it does not depend on the sign of the imaginary part, or on the sign of the sum. Thus, one may expect the digits of arbitrary constant sums to be the same. We give explicit examples for the half-life and thermal conductivity."

However, the nature of the dark matter remains undefined and its origin is still a matter of debate. Many different types of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the observed properties of the dark matter. The International Linear Collider (ILC) aims at finding the origin of dark matter through direct detection of elementary particles, known as Standard Candidates, that are candidates for the dark matter. Some of the recently discovered Standard Candidates were predicted by some of the models of the dark matter. ILC will provide a unique opportunity to test these models by observing the Standard Candidates. In addition, the ILC could help to test some of the cosmological models. The ILC will help to answer the question of the dark matter origin, which has occupied physicists for more than 50 years. Thus, ILC is a challenging and a very important project in the history of physics. The ILC will be built at the Fermilab near Chicago. The construction of ILC has been approved by directors of the ILC Collaboration. Now, the main task is to identify candidates to be observed. After that, the confirmation of these candidates has to be carried out by the experiments in the laboratory. Meanwhile, the ILC will be built and the experiments will be performed. The first measurements of the ILC signals, when they become available, will be a tremendous success and will be a real milestone for particle physics.

The results for $^{13}C_c$ and $^{36}N_c$ in the plasma and vacuum backgrounds are essentially independent.

The channeling probability and the dechanneling probability due to tunneling of the particle under the barrier in the effective transverse potential are estimated. These probabilities depend on the specific scaling parameter characterizing the process. Using the quasiclassical theory of synchrotron radiation we have calculated the contribution to the radiation spectrum, which arises due to the curvature of the channel. This contribution becomes significant to TeV electrons or positrons. Some practical consequences of our results are briefly discussed. © 1996 The American Physical Society.",
    "fake_abstract": " In Wentzel-Kramers theory, the differential operator 〈∂Φ〉 at the boundary of a bent crystal is approximated by the regularized low-order Berestycki matrix 〈H〉. In this regularized form, it is easy to construct the regularized dual field operator, 〈F〉, and to examine its pole structure around the bend. We show that the regularized dual field operator of a bent crystal can be used to express the diffractive process emerging from the bent crystal. This can be useful for the discussion of various nonlinear processes in bent crystals such as tunneling, photon absorption, and photoluminescence."

The basic idea is that the gravitational field of a four-dimensional solution to the equations of general relativity can be decomposed into components in arbitrary dimensions. We show that the homogeneous four-dimensional cosmology provides a natural and observably self-consistent high-dimensional generalization of the standard three-dimensional cosmology. We then consider general two- and three-dimensional cosmologies which arise naturally from the cosmology of our homogeneous model. We show that a two-dimensional cosmology arising from our model and an arbitrary energy-momentum tensor leads to a three-dimensional homogeneous cosmology with a certain set of parameter values. If this cosmology is well-defined for a specific energy-momentum tensor, then the cosmological parameters are precisely determined by the energy-momentum tensor and the solution to the equations of Einstein-Maxwell. We suggest that a three-dimensional cosmology with parameters determined by a single energy-momentum tensor is a well-defined model which is possibly realized in the universe. We give an example of a three-dimensional extended solution of the equation which leads to this cosmology which is well-defined for the Einstein-Maxwell equations in the flat-space limit. "

The rates for both the prompt and nonprompt dimuon signals for opposite sign events and for neutrino induced same sign events are determined in a manner that is independent of any theoretical assumptions. The dependence of the rates on neutrino energy is also presented. The measured rate for prompt like sign dimuon production is shown to be incompatable with theoretical predictions. Various kinematical distributions are shown which demonstrate the good agreement between the theoretical predictions for dimuons arising from the production of charmed quarks and the observed data. Kinematical distributions for the same sign events are presented that indicate that the two muons are produced at different space time points. The data indicate that one of muons in a same sign event is associated with the incoming neutrino and that the other muon is associated with the hadronic shower.",

The determination of the faint end of the luminosity function at these redshifts provides important constraints on models of joint evolution of galaxies and AGNs. Methods: We have defined suitable criteria to select faint QSOs in the GOODS fields, checking in detail their effectiveness and completeness. Spectroscopic follow-up of the resulting QSO candidates has been carried out. The confirmed sample of faint QSOs is compared with a brighter one derived from the SDSS. We have used a Monte-Carlo technique to estimate the properties of the luminosity function, checking various parameterizations for its shape and evolution. Results: Models based on Pure Density Evolution show better agreement with observation than models based on Pure Luminosity Evolution. However a different break magnitude with respect to z~2.1 is required at 3.5<z<5.2. Models with a steeper faint end score a higher probability. We do not find any evidence for a flattening of the bright end at redshift z>3.5. Conclusions: The estimated space density evolution of QSOs indicates a suppression of the formation and/or feeding of Supermassive Black Holes at these redshifts. The QSO contribution to the UV background is insufficient to ionize the IGM at 3.5<z<5.2.",
    "fake_abstract": " We use the high-redshift red sequence (RSS) of GOODS North, South and North Galactic Plane observations to determine the luminosity function of QSOs, while using the SDSS native z~1.8 selection to simultaneously draw the southern field. We find that the slope of the luminosity function (LF) is ~1.4 for QSOs in the South Galactic halo, consistent with the estimate from the SDSS red sequence of 1.2. The QSOLF is 3.3 higher than the SDSS red sequence at , the peak of the QSOLF, and 2.0 higher at . A significant fraction of this effect is due to the SDSS red sequence selection of sources at large distances, where the flux density of QSOs is ~3.2 times higher than that of the non-QSOs (NQSOs). The contribution of the SDSS red sequence to the two peaks of the QSOLF is ~0.7, which is suggestive of the need to include QSOs with large redshifts in the SDSS z~1.8 red sequence to fully understand their LF. We note that the slight excess of QSOs at larger than the peak of the LF may be due to a small number of objects with large proper motion that are missed by the SDSS z~1.8 selection at large proper motion. The excess at larger than the peak of the LF is negligible, and may be due to either a small number of low-luminosity QSOs or to a small number of unidentified, non-QSOs with the same proper motion as the QSOs. The difference between the two peaks at is slightly higher for the dipole field than for the quadrupole field. However, the difference between the two peaks at is significantly larger for dipole than for quadrupole."

In order to develop this analysis we evaluate the electromagnetic field Green tensor on the imaginary frequency axis. The expression for the Casimir-Polder force is derived in the general case of anisotropic polarizability. In dependence of the eigenvalues for the polarizability tensor and of the orientation of its principal axes, the Casimir-Polder force can be either repulsive or attractive. Moreover, there are situations where the force changes the sign with separation. We show that for an isotropic polarizability tensor the force is always repulsive. At large separations between the microparticle and the string, the force varies inversely as the fifth power of the distance. In the non-retarded regime, corresponding to separations smaller than the relevant transition wavelengths, the force decays as the inverse fourth power of the distance. In the case of anisotropic polarizability, the dependence of the Casimir-Polder potential on the orientation of the polarizability tensor principal axes also leads to the moment of force acting on the particle.",

Using this, we calculate the Casimir-Polder force on the string for different string lengths, zero tension and for a Gaussian-type field. These results are in good agreement with numerical calculations."

The relation arises from the fact that gamma rays are produced in the annihilation of positrons with annihilation photons and rapid recombination with higher energy photons in the early Universe. This simple model describes the gamma-ray and CMB correlation, and we explore its history. The correlation is fastest and richest in the first moments of the history, as the recombination timescale decreases toward the recombination epoch. We explore the history of the correlation and fit the data. We find that the correlation decreases to zero near the recombination epoch, recovers near the recombination epoch, and then decreases again. After the recombination epoch, the correlation becomes very small and then increases. The model makes a good prediction for the observed correlation at z ~ 1 and fits the data well at all later times. Our upper limit on the correlation is (1.1 +/-0.3) x 10^18 cm^-2s^-1s^-1."

A new project, the production of small quantities of electron antiprotons for the use of the International Laboratory at Dounreay, is progressing satisfactorily. A second project for miniaturising the apparatus for the production of positrons for the International Laboratory at Dounreay has been started. The plans for the production of muonic hydrogen by the LEU method at the University of Melbourne have been made available for consideration. In addition there have been a number of small scale projects, which have been reported as individual results. The activities of the CSIRO have been mainly concerned with gathering and analysing knowledge.

    "title": "Radial flow of dust particles in accretion disks.",
    "real_abstract": "We study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellar disks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. This study takes account of the two dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the effects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates faster than particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag force causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward, carrying small (size < 100 micron at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles at intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (> 1 mm at 10 AU) move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire vertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. At large distances from the central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a function of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles have slower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r < 100 AU). This differential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. Dust disks composed mostly of small particles (size < 10 micron) accrete slower than gas disks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion phase.",

The essential difference from the latter is that instead of considering U(1)xU(1) non-R-symmetry, with charges in a corresponding diagonal matrix, we consider two Z_3-symmetries followed by an SU(3) transformation, with resulting off-diagonal elements. From this procedure we obtain a more general Leigh-Strassler deformation, including cubic terms with the same index, for specific values of the coupling constants. We argue that the conformal property of N=4 SYM is preserved, in both beta- (one-parameter) and gamma_{i}-deformed (three-parameters) theories, since the deformation for each amplitude can be extracted in a prefactor. We also conclude that the obtained amplitudes should follow the iterative structure of MHV amplitudes found by Bern, Dixon and Smirnov.",

In this contribution, I briefly review the results from recent studies of NCs, touch on some ideas for their formation, and mention some open issues related to the possible connection between NCs and supermassive black holes.",

Using the measured radial stellar velocity dispersion of the nuclear regions in each cluster, we calculate the masses of the primary and associated clusters. The mass of the main cluster in the nuclear region of each cluster is lower than that in earlier clusters, confirming our prediction based on the theory of cluster growth. We find that the total mass of the cluster, including the primary, is a good predictor of the cluster luminosity. The mass varies linearly with the luminosity: The difference between the mass of the primary and associated clusters and the mass of the associated-cluster nuclear regions is simply the mass of the associated clusters; the difference in mass between an associated cluster and the nuclear region is the mass of the associated cluster itself.

This procedure involves the out-focusing of digital galaxy images numerically, the fitting of the resulting surface-brightness profiles with a single generalised profile model and the extrapolation of the fitted profiles to infinite radial distances. This new system, which we denote `t', differs fundamentally from the `T' system (of the `Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies' series) in that: (1) it enables a galaxy's luminosity profile to be extrapolated without the need for any prior morphological classification, and (2) it is applicable to images of widely different spatial resolutions (including unresolved ones) because it takes into account systematic effects due to differential image resolution. It also differs fundamentally from the Kron system in that: (1) it can be derived directly from surface photometry without the need to go back to the plate scans or CCD frames (unless the surface photometry is of high resolution and/or the galaxies being measured are very bright), and (2) it can cope with merged images (provided they are separable by image-segmentation software). Through worked examples, we demonstrate the stability of `t'-system total magnitudes with respect to morphological type, the seeing conditions at the time of observation, degree of smoothing and limiting isophote. We also compare and contrast the new system with both the `T' system and the Kron system, and investigate the advantages and limitations of each of the three systems.",

The method is based on extending the old concept of the He III/He II recombination line as a standard for galactic extinctions to the case of galaxies.

We apply the method to the nearby galaxies to determine the total extinctions, and show that the method gives a consistent measure of the extinctions of galaxies. We isolate the system of equations describing the effects of the stellar populations and interstellar matter, and show that the total magnitude of a galaxy can be determined within one order of magnitude by all of these variables. Since the method is based on empirical relations, it is a simple, fast and accurate method to estimate the total magnitude of a galaxy. We use the method to estimate the total magnitude of the nearby galaxies, and show that they are in the same range as the average, while the structure is similar to that of the best-classified systems. Both the near and far galaxies show the same pattern of faintest to brightest galaxies, and the faintest galaxies are about 1 mag. fainter than the brightest. The method shows that the galaxies are of similar luminosity, with an average luminosity of about M__eyd = 0.6 - 2.1 Â± 0.1. These results suggest that the total magnitudes of galaxies are in the range M__eyd = 0.4 - 1.0, and that the faintest galaxies are probably under-sampled by the present survey. "

In a given luminosity range cool and warm galaxies are considered as those sources that are found approximately $1 \\sigma$ below and above the mean color in the far-infrared $C - L_{TIR}$ diagram. We find that galaxy radio surface brightness is well correlated with color whereas size is less well correlated with color. Our analysis indicates that IR galaxies that are dominated by cool dust are large, massive spirals that are not strongly interacting or merging and presumably the ones with the least active star formation. Dust in these cool objects is less centrally concentrated than in the more typical luminous and ultra-luminous IR galaxies that are dominated by warm dust. Our study also shows that low luminosity early type unbarred and transitional spirals are responsible for the large scatter in the $C - L_{TIR}$ diagram. Among highly luminous galaxies, late type unbarred spirals are predominately warm, and early type unbarred and barred are systematically cooler. We highlight the significance of $C - L_{TIR}$ diagram in terms of local and high redshifts sub-millimeter galaxies.",

The galaxies are classified as cool or warm, based on surface brightness temperatures derived by combining IR/optical photometry with X-ray/optical spectroscopy. Cooling histories are probed by measuring the radial change in surface brightness profile along the line of sight, while the stacking of images is used to estimate the total optical depth of the galaxy. The combined effects of star formation and dust obscuration are explored by examining the correlation between the optical depth and the stellar mass, age and dust-to-gas ratio. Finally, the correlations between the surface brightness profile and UV/optical colour and the surface brightness profile, optical colour, surface brightness profile and UV/optical extinction are explored. Warm galaxies show cooler colours and structures from optical, UV/optical and IR photometry and have higher optical depths than nearby cool galaxies. The correlation between the optical depth and stellar mass for warm galaxies is consistent with, and generally stronger than, the correlation for cool galaxies. Cool galaxies have smaller stellar masses and ages (but similar dust-to-gas ratios) than their hot counterparts. For cool galaxies and hot galaxies, the correlations between surface brightness profiles and optical colours show that cool galaxies have brighter and redder colours, while hot galaxies have bluer and more UV- and IR-obscured colours. For cool galaxies, the correlations between surface brightness profiles, optical colours and UV/optical extinction show a trend indicating a weak link between optical colours and UV/optical extinction. Warming of a galaxy, as determined by the ratio of optical depths, occurs between 1-2 Gyr after formation and is indicative of a trend of increasing star formation and dust obscuration. Warm galaxies appear to be vanishingly rare in the local universe but are prominent in the nearby universe."

We use this to investigate whether the useful monopole aperture-mass shear formulae generalize to all multipoles and to flexions. We re-derive the result of Schneider and Bartelmann that the shear multipole m at radius R is completely determined by the mass multipole at R, plus specific moments Q^m_in and Q^m_out of the mass multipoles internal and external, respectively, to R. The m>=0 multipoles are independent of Q_out. But in contrast to the monopole, the m<0 multipoles are independent of Q_in. These internal and external mass moments can be determined by shear (and/or flexion) data on the complementary portion of the plane, which has practical implications for lens modelling. We find that the ease of E/B separation in the monopole aperture moments does {\\em not} generalize to m!=0: the internal monopole moment is the {\\em only} non-local E/B discriminant available from lensing observations. We have also not found practical local E/B discriminants beyond the monopole, though they could exist.

Moreover, as an example, we relate the measured cosmographic set to the free parameter of LambdaCDM, being the matter density Omegam. In fact, by inverting Omega m in terms of the cosmographic set, it would be possible to infer limits on it. We find results in agreement with other kind of cosmological constraints.",
    "fake_abstract": " Cosmography of the Hubble parameter reveals a promising tool for mapping the distribution of the Universe. It may be used to describe the evolution of cosmic structures such as clusters and galaxies, the evolution of cosmic gas, and the evolution of the CDM model. We illustrate the method with cosmological data for the Hubble parameter and the present baryon density and for the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio. We demonstrate that the method can be used to study the cosmology of most regions of the Universe. "

    "title": "Have Gluinos Been Observed at the $p \\bar{p}$ Collider?.",
    "real_abstract": "The recently observed five single-jet events with missing pT>~35 GeV can be consistently explained by gluinos (g̃), i.e., the supersymmetric partners of the gluons (g), produced via qq―→g̃g̃ and gg→g̃g̃, with a mass in the range 15≲mq̃≲45 GeV. Reducing the pTmiss cut to the 4σ level further constrains this range to 25≲mg̃≲45 GeV.",
    "fake_abstract": " We consider the possibility of observing the gluinos at the $p \\bar{p}$ collider. An insight of the gluino spectrum both at the LHC and the future collider can provide crucial input to the GUT phenomenology, in addition to being a test of the gauge symmetry. A phenomenological interpretation of the gluino mass and a prediction are proposed, as well as a scenario to observe the gluinos at the LHC."

    "title": "Atomic interferometry using stimulated Raman transitions.",
    "real_abstract": "The mechanical effects of stimulated Raman transitions on atoms have been used to demonstrate a matter-wave interferometer with laser-cooled sodium atoms. Interference has been observed for wave packets that have been separated by as much as 2.4 mm. Using the interferometer as an inertial sensor, the acceleration of a sodium atom due to gravity has been measured with a resolution of 3×10−6 after 1000 sec of integration time.",
    "fake_abstract": " We consider the problem of atomic interferometry using stimulated Raman transitions on an atom-atom space. The atoms are arranged in a linear array, which gives rise to two-photon transitions. We propose to use the coherent phase-matching between the two beams to create the required local optical field. We tune the phase-matching by changing the relative phase of the two stimulated Raman transitions. We show that the phase-matching can be used to create an effective phase-matching that is large enough to place a constraint on the phase of the Raman transition. This phase-matching constraint can be exploited to create an atomic interferometer. We give an example of using stimulated Raman transitions with an atomic interferometer."
